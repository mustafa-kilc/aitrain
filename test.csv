I'm also not familiar with the implementation, but I would prefer that
automatically installed packages stay automatically installed, so that
they have the possibility of being automatically removed when no longer
needed.

I use ""hold"" liberally to weather Sid storms.  There are two cases I
see crop up: one, aptitude suggests removing packages without an
obvious replacement.  Two, aptitude marks things as broken that have
been working just fine.  In either case, I start slamming the ""="" key
until packages will no longer be removed, and nothing is marked
broken.  This works 99.99% of the time.  At some later period when I
suspect the storm has passed, I test the waters by unholding the
packages and gauging aptitude's reaction.

I also use ""hold"" when apt-listbugs + some investigation leads me to
believe I'm better off with the current version.  (There's some reason
I don't use forbid-version, but I don't recall.  Maybe it wasn't
persisting between sessions?  But that would have been years ago.)

All of which is to say, just because I've marked a package on hold
doesn't mean that I want it on my system forever.  But if that's the
only way to deal with the problem, then I can certainly manage.  My
system is ancient, and there are already plenty of package on it whose
presence I can't easily explained.  What's the harm in a few more?

If this is a misuse of ""hold"" and there's a better way, though, I'm
all ears.  Rereading, it seems like ""forbid-version"" would be the
right call for most of what I'm doing, assuming it does persist
between aptitude sessions.

I setup last year two huawei modems and failed to setup one. As people
posted the product/vendor ids are crucial for the system to load the
appropriate setup and as far as I remember not all huawei modems are

Lately, a fairly large % of the spam I've been getting has been coming from
spam systems that forge my own address as the ""from"" address... Those spam
messages would get through any whitelist I set up (especially since I email
stuff to myself all the time).  If whitelists become more popular, I
imagine spammers will resort to doing that for the majority of their spams,
making whitelists less helpful.

Plus, I'm still not sure how I feel about whitelists.  I don't think I'm so
special that people should need to fill out a special form just to send me
email.  I could see certain friends of mine getting fairly annoyed
(especially those with multiple email addresses...).

Asterisk in Debian/Lenny claims to be bristuffed, not? At least the
the Debian patch tracking system shows the bristuff-patches:

[1] http://bit.ly/bRRHe7

We have a QuadBRI-Card and recently needed support from Junghanns.net
but they refused telling us there is no bristuff installed because of
the show version output:

*CLI> show version
Asterisk 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1 built by pbuilder @ grnetbox on a  
x86_64 running Linux on 2009-12-14 19:04:56 UTC

Why was the ""bristuffed"" line removed? Debian/Etch did have that
postfix.

After telling them Debian/Lenny IS bristuffed they said this
""installation method"" is not supported. Huh?!
Does anyone has a comment on this?

16,ham,"[ILUG] semaphores on linux RH7.3Hi All,

I have a question which is a bit tricky and was
wondering of anyone has come across this problem
before or could point me in the right direction.

I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to
Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way
semaphores  are being handled. The application uses
mulitple processes to run application code with the
main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o
be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled
via semaphores.

In certain circumstances the main process and the
application child process seem to lock up both waiting
for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I
have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that
the semaphore code is doing the correct things for
syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the
semop() system call.

I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay
between changing semaphore states the problem goes
away, but this causes our entire application to run
really sloooww !! lol

Is there anything weird or different with the standard
implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could
cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state

in a semaphore immediately?

Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==
EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails
(-1) also fixes the problem but again system
performance goes down the toilet.

both the parent controlling process run as the same
uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with
permissions 0666.

Any pointers would be appreciated!

Rgds,

Colin Nevin

I knew it'd be a day for insanity.

so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.

Slashdot, of course, links to them.

So now, I link to slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:

We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.

The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.

At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.

When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there

I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not
100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working
so great anymore.

92,spam,"DEAR SIR,

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha, who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likewise developing a cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of thirty-six million United States Dollars (US$36,000,000) in cash, which I intend to use for investment purposes specifically in your country. This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multi-Billion Dollar Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The Russian partners returned my husband's share of US$36,000,000 after his death and lodged it with my late husband's security company in Nigeria, of which I am a director.

Right now, the new civilian government has intensified its probe on my husband's financial resources and they have revoked our licenses that allow us to own a financial and oil company. In view of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and deposited it in a privately erected security safe abroad. No record ever existed concerning the money, neither is the money traceable by the Government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning the Government's attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this money into your safe bank account. On your consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us to discuss details of this transaction.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 20% of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance. Your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further contacts.

95,spam,"I am Edward Mulete JR., the son of Mr. STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara Got your contact through her private search. Due to the current war against white farmers in Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to claim all white-owned farms in our country to gain favor for re-election, all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms to the government for redistribution, and in fact, to his political party members.

My father, though black, was the treasury of the farmers' association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not support the president's idea. He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay to invade my father's farm and burn everything in the farm. They killed my father and took away many items from the farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father handed us over will documents with instructions from my father that we should leave Zimbabwe in case anything happened to him. The will documents contain a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit kept in custody for us in a security company, unknown to the company, which confirms that the content is money. The total amount is US$21.5M.

We are therefore soliciting your assistance to help us move the funds out of Zimbabwe, as our fate and future are uncertain. Hence, this email to you. The president's present ban on international press into Zimbabwe and the resignation of the Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund transfer clearance above US$1M is just a few of the unthinkable things happening in our country.

I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia, who was living in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family late last year following this ugly development, to no avail. Should you be interested in helping us, contact me immediately via email for easy communication, and I will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of the transaction.

We have concluded a wonderful plan to carry out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that this transaction is 100% confidential and risk-free and will not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any account of your choice where the incident of taxation will not take much toll on the money, and we look forward to coming over to your country to invest our share and settle there.

I will have a private phone so that our conversation can be 100% confidential. Please do not use the reply button, reply only to Edmulete7@netscape.net.

119,spam,"I am Dr James Alabi, the chairman of contract award and review committee set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of N.N.P.C. The original values of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of US$12,320,000.00 (Twelve Million Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand United State Dollars). This amount has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully Paid and the projects officially commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts in due course. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonefide beneficiary.

Once more I want you to understand that having put in over twenty-five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this transaction, if favorable we will take further steps to brief you the full details of this viable transaction.

I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from in full honor. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this transfer in the next batch which would constitute the new quarter payments for the 2002 financial year.

Thank you and God bless.

Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is developing our technology events for Waters Conferences and Joel Hanley will be starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.

EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th of May, and I am keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend to call each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would like to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference seminars at EPRM 2001?

154,ham,"In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM
ds = mu * s * dt + sigma * s * dz
where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.
Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation
for the option price, regardless of mu.

With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula. Fine. No
problem.

Question comes here. Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows,
say, mean-reverting process
ds = beta (alpha - s) dt + sigma * s * dz
Apparently, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However,
using the delta hedging argument, we still get the same BS differential equation,
with the same boundary condition, we get the same BS formula.

Not fair!

From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the
underlying, which is the lognormal distribution.

My thinking is: can I derive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE?
The answer should be yes, but got to be from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.
Then what we do about the delta-hedging argument?

i am kingsley muntu, decillion financial services south africa. this is an urgent and confidential business proposition.
on june 14, 2000, a foreign consultant with the global oil corporation, mr. alan baker made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at us $ 8,320,000.00, with us. upon maturity, i sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. after a month, a reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his contract employers, global oil corporation that mr. baker passed away.
on further investigation, i found out that he died without making a will or a testament, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. i also discovered that mr. baker did not declare any kin or relations in any of his official documents, including his deposit paperwork in my possession. this has been fixed under our management. no one will ever come forward to claim it.
consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the beneficiary to this investment. i am writing to you because i cannot operate a foreign account. i want to present you as the beneficiary of the funds so that you claim on my behalf with the help of my attorney.
please provide me with your full names and address so that my attorney prepares the necessary documents, which will put you in place as the beneficiary to this investment.
please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction will be of mutual benefit, as you will be entitled to 30 % of the money and the remaining 70 % for my own investment. if you are interested, reply me by email for further details.

Reuters Market News
  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 

  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.

  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.

  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 

  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 

  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

Now that oil and gas has entered a long-term bull market, our specialty in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining undervalued energy plays has produced soaring returns. Emerson Oil and Gas (EOGI) is an energy developer in the US oil belt and in Canada's most highly coveted reservoirs with generating potential of millions per week.

Watch this stock Friday morning:  
Symbol: EOGI  
Price: $0.09

The value of EOGI's shares will skyrocket:  
Breaking news!!!  
Emerson Oil and Gas identifies lease opportunity in South Texas providing opportunity for 22- re-entry in the field with strong producing history and large recoverable reserves.  
South Texas is a large existing field that was discovered and drilled by major oil companies in the 1970s. The field is established with substantial recoverable reserves, estimated at over 3.9 million barrels of oil and about 2 billion cubic ft. of gas in the two pay zones.

1. Price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull market in a generation.  
2. Natural gas prices have tripled in the last two years.  
3. With multiple projects in high-gear and the expanding production on reserves worth multi-millions, EOGI is selling for less than 1/4 the value of its assets.  
4. Emerson Oil and Gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises.  

Already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market. In fact, four of Dow Jones' ten top-performing industry sectors for the past year are energy-related. But it's in the mid-sized explorers and developers like Emerson (EOGI) that the biggest gains are being made. In the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns.  

Our subscribers need to pay particular attention to undervalued EOGI shares, because it won't be a bargain for long. This small company with a comparably small market value is sitting on a bonanza of oil and gas reserves—an unrecognized bonus for investors, especially with the daily jump in energy prices.  

But all that will change in a few short weeks, as these reserves move into production, bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to capture the attention of the market, and have an equally explosive effect on the share price.

What will the cash flow from these projects do for the price of Emerson Oil and Gas' shares? Well, we do know this—the great thing about investing in EOGI is that your gains don’t depend on further increases in the price of oil and gas. Even if energy prices stay flat, or decline slightly, you will still make a very healthy return. Of course, energy prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year or so as predicted, meaning the value of EOGI’s assets and earnings will soar even higher. In that case, the reward for investors will be staggering.

Overall, we consider EOGI to be one of the last outstanding energy plays in the oil and gas sector. Once this discovery has been realized, EOGI shares will surge sharply on heavy investor attention.
