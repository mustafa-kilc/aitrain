I have been receiving emails saying that I'm contributing to the ""moral decay of society"" by selling the Banned CD.  That may be, but I feel strongly that you have a right to benefit from 
this hard-to-find information. 

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 

With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next advertisement! 
  

Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 


 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 

Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

13,13,spam,"Would you like to look and feel 10-20 years younger? Would you be interested in increasing energy levels by 84%? How about increasing sexual potency by 75%? Would you like to increase your muscle strength by 88% while simultaneously reducing body fat by 72% and wrinkles by 51%?

Of course, you would! We offer the most potent oral GH formula available to help you achieve all of this and more! Turn back the clock and turn up the energy now!

In thousands of clinical studies, GH has been shown to accomplish the following:

Reduce body fat and build lean muscle without exercise!
Enhance sexual performance
Remove wrinkles and cellulite
Lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol profile
Improve sleep, vision, and memory
Restore hair color and growth
Strengthen the immune system
Increase energy and cardiac output
Turn back your body's biological time clock 10-20 years in 6 months of usage!
Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week thanking us for what our product has done: ""I am astounded! The day before I started taking GH1, I took blood tests. Then I began using GH1 as directed. After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. My 'biological' age is now that of a 40-year-old!"" - Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY

""A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80—and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"" - Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA

""After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher level of energy, increased sexual energy, and my memory and vision were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after a workout—and it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, I only need 5 hours of sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!"" - Anonymous",indecent,sexual content,"spam,indecent,sexual content"

this hard-to-find information. So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next advertisement! 
  Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!Please Click the URL for the Detail! http://%62a%6E%6E%65d%63%64.%6E%65%74 You are receiving this special offer because you have provided permission to receive third party email communications regarding special online advertisements or offers.

89,89,spam,"REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ï¿½TOP SECRET.ï¿½ 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: (a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. (b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. (c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. (d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. Thank you and God bless. Yours faithfully, Dr. Osaro Ame __________________________________________________

Hi, my name is RK Hendrick.


I have been a prosecutor, defense attorney, family law attorney, and

a former pro-tem judge, and needless to say,

I've seen it all and I'm sick to death of the abuse in our legal system,

in the way men are treated by the courts.


But more importantly, I am fed up with the way women

get it all.  They can just about do whatever they want

and the courts, prosecutors, police, they're almost

always on their side.


I've written a book and I want you to have the first

chapter of it absolutely free.  And, it's for men only. 

The title of my book is  ""How To Avoid Getting Screwed When Getting Laid""

Visit my site at:     www.protectionguideformen.com


Now listen, I realize that I can not prevent women from

reading this book. I know that. In fact it would be illegal

for me to try and do so. 


So, for men only, you need to get your copy.. there's

a pretty good chance that as this book takes off in

the marketplace - which it already has started to do -

women you know will have gotten their copy...


You need to have the protection and knowledge that

I have written for you.


Get your complimentary first chapter right  here:

www.protectionguideformen.com

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.� I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.� It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""� Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.� I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!� Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.� Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.�I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.� 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!� You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.� This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!�

Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes it hundreds of times easier to win online.

He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in online contests—over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop). We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we're putting it online for our members to use.

THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!

If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours to keep—GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael's program is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn't violate their rules. So if you win a prize, you'll receive it. If you don't receive it, we'll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.

FREE TO USE.

Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for are related network expenses—which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service. That's dozens of entries for what you'd usually pay to get a single lottery ticket!

As a member in good standing of this mailing, we've already set up the automatic entry system for you. All that's left is for you to turn it on. Once you do, you can sit back and watch it enter you into contest after contest after contest....

Selves back to the year 1377 and look at the picture with the eyes of the person who painted it. Let us begin with a search for his purpose and meaning at least. The picture is a diptych—that is to say, it is a painting done upon two wings or shutters hinged, so as to allow of their being closed together. You have no doubt been wondering why I called it a portrait, for the picture is far from being what today would commonly be described as such. Richard himself is not even the most conspicuous figure; and he is kneeling and praying to the Virgin. What should we think if any living sovereign, ordering a state portrait, had himself portrayed surrounded on one side by his predecessors on the throne, and on the other side by the Virgin and Child and angels?

All children are different and will generally route around whatever technique you learned from relatives, books, talk shows, or the last child. Just when you get good at being a parent, you're done. Don't overprotect. I always called this ""First Baby Syndrome."" A neighbor at one point had a 4 or 5-year-old who would choke on jello, probably because she never allowed him to have solid food until he was far too old, in my opinion. I fed mine cereal, etc., early and let them get the hang of it. I always want my kids to be able to handle anything if I'm not there, so I have them try it out when I am. (Within limits, of course.)

Yet he read much about the war. Some of the recounted episodes deeply and ineffaceably impressed him. For example, an American newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the German army marching, marching steadily along a great Belgian high road--a procession without beginning and without end--and of the procession being halted for his benefit, and of a German officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane, while the man stood stiffly at attention. George had an ardent desire to spend a few minutes alone with that officer; he could not get the soldier's bruised cheek out of his memory.
Good-evening once more, Miss Nowell, he said. 

I _might_, you knaoo! said Marrier, brightening to full hope in the fraction of a second.General, the Chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped recruits. Now, if we try to outmarch them, they will catch us in the woods and shoot every one of us before we can get to Ernee. We must argue, as you call it, with cartridges. During the skirmish, which will last more time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch the National Guard and the militia from Fougeres.   What could it all mean? Why that medium for her message? Should he write and ask her? But what was there to ask or say, in the face of her silence? Besides, he had not even her address. Miss Camilla could doubtless give him that. But would she? How much did she understand? Why had she turned so unhelpful? .She wouldn't see him. She's very strong-willed.... That's a wonderful woman, hibody  Io's voice shook a little.  
We can't stop their tongues, he said at last. Ah! I did a foolish thing!  

She turned upon him the sparkle of golden lights in wine-brown eyes. It's a fairy bower. I'm going to do a bewitchment.  What makes you think it was Colonel de Peyster or any other English or Tory officer who saved me from the Indians? Well, it wasn't. If Colonel Bird and your other white friends had had their way when I was taken I should have been burned at the stake long before this. It was the Wyandot chief, Timmendiquas, known in our language as White Lightning, who saved me.  

 I beg your pardon, the stranger said, addressing him in pure and limpid English, which sounded to Philip like the dialect of the very best circles, yet with some nameless difference of intonation or accent which certainly was not foreign, still less provincial, or Scotch, or Irish; it seemed rather like the very purest well of English undefiled Philip had ever heard,--only, if anything, a little more so; I beg your pardon, but I'm a stranger hereabouts, and I should be so VERY much obliged if you could kindly direct me to any good lodgings.  Yes, said she. The landlady wanted the money, she told me. So Nellie gave me her share, and I paid it at once.

He belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures, who are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no matter what its nature may be. So advertisement had come to him tardily, and by virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. He had been made a sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a major, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. His life had been so blameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. It is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother. For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. He himself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and gaily-endured hardships of the soldier's lot. He knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--his children, as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes.  Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe.  Yes, I shall outlive it, else I should have little faith in myself. But I shall not forget; and if you would remain forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. I doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it. But I have no right to condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it. You must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend.  What's the price, asked Ellis, of the cigar and the compliment together? In other words, what do you want of me? 
A boat? Lord, that sounds good! sighed Banneker. 
'Brian is not unkind to you, I hope?' cried Bessie, prepared to be indignant. 


 by a new destroyer--a gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary. Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow-men. As promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious X.Y.Z. who will--for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps--impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten a-week may be made by any individual, male or female;--under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, Captain Paget plied his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. Of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St. James's-street into some dingy transpontine hiding-place. But he never went back to Tulliver's-terrace, though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother's debt. When her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her that he would see about it--i.e. the payment of Mrs. Kepp's bill; while, if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother's extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use.

293,293,spam,"GAMING ADVISOR  NEWS July 16, 2002   i2corp Enters into Research and Development Agreement with Nevada Gaming Equipment Supplier For Live Remote Bingo.      
 
The general feeling of the Top Internet Lawyers and Analysts is that ""online gambling and sports betting is here to stay.Â” Attempts at trying to stop it would be largely ineffective! Banning Internet gambling and sports betting presents technical and legal problems that Governments are ill equipped to enforce. WhatÂ’s more, there are NO competitors for the CompanyÂ’s method or technology for remote wagering. i2corp is the Only Company in the World that can legally license its method and technology for remote wagering. i2corp is currently negotiating with
Major Casinos Globally.    
 
Michael Pollock of the Pollock Gaming Resource Group (PRRG) has issued a report studying the effects of live wagering from remote locations. Â“ The study concludes that live wagering from remote locations does more than create a new source of revenue for sponsoring casinos. Additionally, it creates a marketing opportunity, a means to find and cultivate thousands of new customers who can be encouraged to become on-site patrons.Â” A copy of the full report in pdf format can be downloaded at http://www.gamingobserver.com/.
 
i2corp is the holding company for Home Gambling Network, Inc. HGN holds U.S. Patent 5,800,268, which covers remote wagering on live games and events with electronic financial transactions. The Patent is comprised of three primary actions: the gambling is live; the player is remote and physically away from the actual game or event; and the winnings and losses are transacted electronically in real time. They include, but are not limited to, horse racing, soccer, bingo, poker, roulette and many other Las Vegas Casino Games. FACT: Currently there is an overwhelming opinion that remote wagering in real-time will become one of the most profitable/prolific industries worldwide. i2corp recently won judgment against giant UUNET a subsidiary of MCI/WorldCom in a U.S. Federal Court for Patent infringement. Just another compelling reason why i2corp has orphaned their competition! Therefore we conclude i2corpÂ’s common stock to be overlooked and undervalued! RECOMMENDATION: STRONG BUY     i2corp

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Here’s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other people’s judgments?  That’s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.

Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something “on the side” that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity you’ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You don’t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!

Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained

I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com


Kind regards,

Stanley Woodwork.

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

""...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring, piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.""

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework, Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Facades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups, Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material, Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc. Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products, and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)

El sistema de mini-plantas esta diseñado de forma que todas las maquinas de produccion van instaladas fijas sobre la propia plataforma del contenedor, con el cableado, tuberias e instalaciones; es decir, completamente equipadas... y a partir de ese momento estan listas para producir."" Mas de 700 sistemas de produccion portatil: Panaderias, Produccion de clavos de acero, Electrodos para soldadura, Recauchutado de neumaticos, Curvado de hierro para armaduras de construccion, Lamina perfilada para cubiertas, techos y cerramientos de fachada, Bidones de chapa, Cubos de aluminio, Menaje de polipropileno inyectado, Piezas de melamina prensada (vasos, platos, tazas, cafeteras, etc.) Silenciadores para vehiculos, Malla electrosoldada para la construccion, Bolsas y envases de plastico, Unidades moviles de asistencia medica, Material sanitario (jeringas hipodermicas, Pinzas hemostaticas, etc.)

Science Network ha puesto en marcha un proceso de Co-inversion para la instalacion de pequeñas Plantas ensambladoras para fabricar en serie las Mini-plantas de produccion portatil, en el lugar, region o pais que lo necesite. Una de las caracteristicas relevantes es el hecho de que dichas plantas quedaran conectadas al Sistema del Comercio Mundial (WTS) con acceso a mas de 50 millones de mercancias, materia primas, productos, servicios y las operaciones automaticas de comercio internacional. Resulta obvio que por razones economicas, de costes y de impacto social, lo apropiado es instalar plantas ensambladoras en los mismos paises y regiones asi como utilizar los recursos locales (mano de obra, ciertos equipamientos, etc.)

It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me. However, I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military ruler, General Sani Abacha, who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him. The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies. Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State, their home state, as a kind of house arrest, and the eldest son is still in detention. Although a lot of money has been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safekeeping to the tune of US$50 million.

This money, US$50 Million, is already in North America and if you are interested, we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds, and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.

Note, there is no risk involved in this project because I am involved as Abacha's confidant. Please you should keep this transaction a top secret, and we are prepared to do more business with you depending on your approach towards this project. I await your urgent response.

Thanks.
Yours Faithfully,
BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.",irrelevant,advertisement,"spam,irrelevant,advertisement"

338,338,spam,"Life Energy and Technology Holdings, Inc. (OTCBB: LETH)

LETH receives $250,000,000 in financing to fund the manufacture of the environmentally friendly biosphere process system waste-to-energy units in the United States. The first unit is set to roll out in New Orleans in early second quarter. We are expecting earth-shattering upcoming news leading to a strong rally in LETH for a company that has announced over $100 million in sales orders in the past year, and tops that record-setting achievement by acquiring the equivalent of $8.62 per share in cash for major worldwide expansion.

Our readers grabbed substantial profits for our March pick:
USHG featured at $0.75 reached $3.65 in 8 days! Traded as high as $7.00 since!

The biosphere process system - soaring worldwide demand:
LETH is utilizing the unique proprietary technology of their biosphere process system to generate revenue from the disposal of a wide variety of waste products at 5 to 7 tons per hour, making a major impact on the global waste problem. This profitable and environmentally safe process converts waste materials such as municipal solid waste, agricultural wastes, forestry wastes, medical wastes, industrial wastes, sewage sludge, shale oil, sour natural gas, and the huge market of used tires into clean, green electricity. LETH profits from the sale of electricity created from waste conversion on a continuous basis by generating 5 to 10 mega-watts per hour of electricity, which is then sold to replenish the local or national grid.

The biosphere process succeeds in filling an urgent worldwide need for cost-effective renewable energy sources and a corresponding universal need to solve critical problems in the disposal of waste. LETH has secured worldwide acceptance for a revolutionary product designed to significantly impact the global waste problem while a major push for generating electricity from alternative sources continues to be a hot topic due to shortages and massive power failures.

Financing of $250 million positions LETH for astronomical sales:
The magnitude of this financing package goes much deeper than the fact that this $1.50 stock now has accessible capital equivalent to $8.62 per common share in cash. There are 26 biosphere process systems presently in operation worldwide. The available funding could easily be used to produce 100 additional biospheres. Now factor in that the average sale price is $7 million per biosphere. We cannot even comprehend what this stock should be trading for with a potential $700,000,000 in future sales with 29 million shares outstanding!

LETH Stock Guidance:
Current Price: $1.80
Near-term Target: $4.80
Projected High for '04: $12.50

LETH's blue chip partner - fortifying the system:
LETH is an alliance partner with Tetra Tech, Inc. (NASDAQ: TTEK, $21), a leader and one of the largest providers in environmental, mechanical, and electrical management consulting services primarily for the U.S. government with annual sales of $800 million. Tetra Tech will coordinate the securing of necessary permits, installation, and continuous worldwide monitoring of the biosphere process system for LETH. Tetra Tech is now in the process of obtaining Department of Environmental Quality permitting for the biosphere process in the state of Louisiana. This is a monumental event for LETH, opening the floodgates for major project revenues in Louisiana while having a parallel effect on LETH stock in the form of a huge near-term announcement.

Political power fosters rapid global expansion:
LETH has captured the profit-making attention of both U.S. and international investors by embracing a major foothold on the global waste problem as well as the urgent need to generate electricity from alternative sources. This has been accomplished by successfully creating major inroads to all corners of the globe through the political contacts at the highest level from Dr. Albert Reynolds, chairman of LETH, who is also the former Prime Minister of Ireland. Dr. Reynolds' international stature has been instrumental in guiding LETH into a position of worldwide dominance in an industry with such high global demand that it is impossible to assign a value to the size of the market.

Uncommon value for a company of this caliber:
We are witnessing a breakout year in the making judging by the frequency of recently announced sales contracts for the biosphere, the impressive backlog of over $100 million in sales orders, and the company's very solid financial position. We view this perfectly timed convergence of events as the catalyst for additional contracts that will perpetuate the shattering of the company's own sales records. As our top stock pick for April, we anticipate the continuation of strong positive developments that will ignite LETH shares, which carry our highest rating for short-term trading profits followed by robust long-term capital gains.

Those hours of the night were precious, but Fremont did not use them. Defeated, he held back, magnifying the numbers of his enemy, fearing that Jackson was in front of him with his whole army, and once more out of touch with his ally, Shields. 
I did not ring. What made you come in without orders? Go away, Suzette. 

Gale turned his eyes down-stream to the barracks, and noted that the long flag-staff had at last been erected. Even as he looked he saw a bundle mounting towards its tip, and then beheld the Stars and Stripes flutter out in the air, while the men below cheered noisily. It was some time before he answered. I'm not afraid, if that's all, she answered in a very firm tone. I love you, and I trust you, and I could follow you to the world's end--or, if needful, out of it. But there's one other question. Bertram, ought I to?   I 've had a regularly splendid time, and thank you ever so much, she said when the good-nights were being exchanged..Who knows? He was, perhaps, a savage. Yet he may have been tender-hearted. I hope so, if he is going to be fixed in bronze for the ages to stare at.  
Mr. Barnett, will you go aloft and keep me posted? said the captain.  

Harley always travelled light, carrying only two valises, and an hour sufficed for his packing. Then, like the old campaigner that he was, he slept soundly, and early the next morning he went again to the hotel at which the Graysons were staying. He felt a little hesitation in sending up a card so soon, knowing what swarms of people Mr. Grayson had been compelled to receive and how badly he must stand in need of rest, but there was no help for it.  Let me look at it. 

 That trip was full of dangers for you, and, as we go through all this Western country, there may be more to come. I want the right, Sylvia, to look after you, to look after you more closely than I've ever done before, and to do that, Sylvia, I've got to be your husband.  No one will take thy place with me, my daughter.

Her voice failed her as she uttered the last sentence. But she restrained herself after the first sob that heaved her overladen bosom, and stood calmly awaiting the answer to her urgent petition.  Neither now nor afterwards, Mr. Lynde.  A movement of astonishment ran through the assembly.  What does the information bureau of the Seven Seas know about it? 
WHO told you I was dead? I asked, sternly. 
And then in two columns of leaded type, under a pyramid of head-lines, was told the story of Sylvia Morgan. Flushed with enthusiasm, the account said, she had come from Idaho to help her uncle, the candidate. Although only eighteen years of age--she was twenty-two--she had displayed a most remarkable perception and grasp of politics and of great issues. It was she, with her youthful zeal, who inspired Mr. Grayson and his friends with courage for a conflict against odds. He consulted her daily about his speeches; it was she who always put into them some happy thought, some telling phrase that was sure to captivate the people. In a pinch she could make a speech herself, and she would probably be seen on the stump in the West. And she was as beautiful as she was intellectual and eloquent; she would be the most picturesque feature of this or

Yes! cried Sylvia, how I have honored Adam for that steadfastness, and how I have despised myself, because I could not be as wise and faithful in the earlier, safer sentiment I felt for Geoffrey.

Wysak Petroleum (WYSK)
Current Price: $0.21
Wysak Petroleum announces the signing of a letter of intent with the European Commission Baltic Renewable Energy Centre (EC BREC) to assist Wysak Petroleum in the development of the Wysak Wind Power Project.

EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a full-sized commercial wind power project in Europe. This letter states that EC BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financial structuring and investment, regulatory issues, government policies, negotiations, wind technologies, and other aspects relating to wind power.

About the Wysak Wind Project
This development will be up to a maximum 90 MW in size and cost upwards of $120 million in development expenditures. Once completed, this wind park will supply upwards of 170,000 MW of electricity annually for Poland and the European community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with electricity and offset nearly 170,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases. Total gross electric sales over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 million for a project this size.

About the EC Baltic Renewable Energy Centre
The mission of the European Commission-founded EC BREC is to stimulate the development of renewable energy sources (RES) in Poland through the construction of RES projects, the development of innovative technologies, and the creation of relevant policies, strategies, and plans. To fulfill the mission, EC BREC uses its own research capabilities and cooperates with partner institutions from the EU, other countries, and international organizations.

About Wysak Petroleum
Wysak is a diversified energy company whose goal is to identify and develop traditional fossil fuel sites, as well as clean air alternative energy producing technologies. Wysak controls one Wyoming federal oil and gas lease in the Bighorn Basin region and another in the Green River Basin. Its two Wyoming state leases are located 45 miles apart within the massive coalbed methane play area of the Powder River Basin. Numerous large petroleum and exploration firms operate near to all of these properties; they include ExxonMobil (XOM), Williams Gas (WMB), and Western Gas (WGR) among others. Collectively, over 26,000 wells produced 54.7 million barrels of oil and 1.75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in Wyoming.

Conclusion:
The examples above show the awesome earning potential of little-known companies that explode onto investors' radar screens; many of you are already familiar with this. Is WYSK poised and positioned to do that for you? Then you may feel the time has come to act... and please watch this one trade Monday! Go WYSK.

TVPredictions.com Newsletter (August 7, 2002)  
The #1 Newsletter on the Future of TV

**Hi Everyone,**

First of all, I want to welcome those subscribers who are getting this newsletter for the first time. Here you will find hard-hitting commentary and analysis on issues related to the future of television. Whether it's Interactive TV, the battle between the cable news networks, the latest in the Emmy race, or the federal government's fight to promote HDTV, TV Predictions will give you the scoop -- before it actually occurs. And, as long-time subscribers will tell you, we pull no punches.  

*(FYI -- TVPredictions.com, based in Los Angeles, is owned and managed by Phillip Swann, author of ""TV dot Com: The Future of Interactive Television."" He has been quoted as an expert on TV issues in publications such as The Hollywood Reporter, Variety, and Electronic Media.)*

Now, in this issue, we offer an all-new edition of...the Interactive TV Power Rankings! Plus: Why TiVo desperately needs to boost its sub numbers during the next five months. And, the latest news on the future of TV.

---

### IN THIS ISSUE

1. Interactive TV Power Rankings!  
2. TiVo: Now or Never?  
3. Breaking News  
4. Coming Attractions!

### Interactive TV Power Rankings!

Every week, we publish the Interactive TV Power Rankings. We rank the 10 companies that are benefiting most from the deployment of new TV technology.

This week's highlights:  
Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV merger? Why did Cox scale back its Video on Demand plans? Why did Liberty Media buy a cable company in the Netherlands? And who at NBC is smoking crack? Find out in this all-new edition of...The Interactive TV Power Rankings!

### TiVo: Now or Never?

The next five months could determine whether TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service, ultimately survives as a business.

TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock dipped below three this week. And network execs are openly questioning whether the digital recorder, which permits skipping commercials with a few clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising models. There even have been hints that the networks could support a move by the cable industry to offer a PVR that does not permit commercial skipping. And that PVR would not be a TiVo.

To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have recommended the service to a friend. And when people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo.

But Wall Street, the media, and the industry are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start putting some big numbers on the board -- and it needs to do it this holiday season. If it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo until now will run for the hills. That will push the company's stock price down even further. And if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices: Sell the company under duress or wait until its funding dries up.

Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch an intensive marketing blitz over the next five months, right through the holiday season. The blitz will include a sharp increase in retail distribution, TV advertising, and PR efforts. The company needs to show Wall Street -- and the industry -- that it will be the brand leader in the PVR category.

### Breaking News

- Cox Cable has decided to slow down its roll-out of Video on Demand?  
- Consumers have no idea what HDTV is all about, according to a new study?

- According to the Associated Press, the cable news networks may be spreading fear in our culture?  
- Las Vegas says West Wing's Martin Sheen is a shoo-in for a Best Actor Emmy?  

These are just some of the many stories now available for reading at TVPredictions.com.

When you are fully booked and overloaded with work, there is still the possibility to use ancient mental working methods, used by successful people, instead of risking stress and burnout problems.

These ancient methods for shortening waiting time, adding power to quicker decision-making, and eliminating stress and the risk of burnout are not commonly used, despite their ancient origins.

The power in these mental working methods claims no extra energy consumption, so the body will not get tired, stressed, or burnt out.

China's rapid economic growth, as ranked by the World Bank, is TEN TIMES 
FASTER than the world economy. 

The only thing US investors should be asking themselves is, ""How can I 
participate in this explosion?"" We have the answer. Texas-based 
CommunicateNow.com, Inc. (OTC BB trading symbol: CMNW) may unlock 
China's amazing potential.

INVESTOR'S TIMING OPPORTUNITY

Texas-based CommunicationsNow.com Inc. (OTCBB trading symbol: CMNW) 
announces today that a top representative from CMNW will be traveling to 
China in an attempt to negotiate with one of China's top manufacturers of
high pressure laminate products for CMNW to act as a worldwide distributor
of its products. You know what the Chinese did to the global steel market:
they captured it! China is now set to conquer another major commodity, and
you can profit right along with them. This is just one example of how CMNW 
may make company history.

Opening China's Door

Using hard-won experience gained in the survivor-takes-all US Internet market, 
CMNW developed technology that makes it possible for China's millions of 
entrepreneurs, small and medium sized companies, and major corporations to 
do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.

CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler 

CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.

CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. 

*** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** 

Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. 

There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico.

NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENT




Sir/Madam;

This note is to inform you of new watchdog board technology for maintaining
continuous unattended operation of PC/Servers etc. that we have released for
distribution.
  
We are proud to announce Watchdog Control Center featuring MAM (Multiple
Applications Monitor) capability.
The key feature of this application enables you to monitor as many
applications as you
have resident on any computer as well as the operating system for
continuous unattended operation.  The Watchdog Control Center featuring
MAM capability expands third party application ""control"" of a Watchdog as
access to the application's
source code is no longer needed.

Here is how it all works:
Upon installation of the application and Watchdog, the user may select
many configuration options, based on their model of Watchdog, to fit their
operational needs.  If the MAM feature is enabled, the user may select any
executable program that they wish for monitoring.

A lock up of the operating system or if any one of the selected
applications is not running, the MAM feature, in
conjunction with the Watchdog, will reset the system allowing for
continuous operation.

It's that simple!

Watchdog Control Center is supported on most Microsoft Windows platforms
(Win9x/WinNT/Win2k) and includes a Linux version for PCI Programmable
Watchdogs.

Watchdog Control Center Features:
- Automated installation
- Controls all Outsource Engineering Watchdogs
- User selectable Watchdog timeout period
- User selectable Watchdog stroke interval
- Multiple Application Monitoring

Included on the Installation CD:
- Watchdog Control Center
- Watchdog Drivers
- Documentation

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco
Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank
with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,
1997.

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive
as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my
branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom
his name shall be used as the
next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not
allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be
recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view
of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing
that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give
you 25% of the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund
transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply
to the bank as a relation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.

Respectfully submitted,

Obi   W.

- Free classifieds: They don’t work anymore.
- Websites: They take thousands of surfers, and banners are expensive and losing their punch.
- E-zines: Hope you have a huge subscriber list.
- Search engines: Forget it unless you’re in the top rankings.

So, what does work?

405,405,spam,"Warning: Potential Scam Email

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I recently received an email that appears to be a scam. The sender claims to be Laurent Mpeti Kabila Jr., the son of the late President Laurent Désiré Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The email solicits assistance in transferring a substantial sum of money and diamonds, assuring that the transaction is risk-free and requires confidentiality.

**Key Details of the Email:**
- The sender claims to have a diplomatic background and requests urgent assistance due to the political situation in the DRC.
- They offer a significant financial incentive (a percentage of $25 million and diamonds) for assistance in receiving funds.
- The email emphasizes confidentiality and suggests that no risk is involved.

This kind of solicitation is common in scams, often involving high-pressure tactics and promises of wealth. I recommend exercising extreme caution and not engaging with the sender or providing any personal information.

If this email was intended for you or someone you know, I advise reporting it to the relevant authorities or your email provider to help prevent potential scams.

Stay safe!

406,406,spam," Warning: Potential Spam Email Regarding Cheap International Calls**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I received an email promoting a service that claims to offer international calls at significantly reduced rates. Here are the details:

**Key Points of the Email:**
- The sender claims you can call international numbers for as low as **NUMBER cents per minute** without needing to sign up or use credit cards.
- They provide instructions for making calls, including a specified access number.
- The email includes vague terms about costs and charges, indicating that calls will not appear on your bill.

This email raises several red flags that suggest it may be spam or a pshing attempt:

1. **Unsolicited Offer:** The email promotes a service without prior consent.
2. **Vague Pricing Structure:** The lack of clarity regarding how charges will appear on bills is concerning.
3. **Request for Unsubscription:** While it offers a way to unsubscribe, such requests are often used by spammers to confirm active email addresses.

I recommend not engaging with the sender, and if you’re interested in international calling options, consider researching reputable services independently.

If you received this email and are concerned about its legitimacy, you may want to report it to your email provider to help prevent future spam.

Stay vigilant!

407,407,spam,"Warning: Potential Spam Email Regarding Discounted Tobacco Products**

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I received an email from ""Smokers United"" promoting discounted cigarettes and tobacco products. Below are the main points of the email:

**Key Details:**
- The email claims to offer **NUMBER cartons of cigarettes** or **NUMBER pouches of rolling tobacco** at prices starting from **NUMBER euros**.
- It provides a link to click for more information and claims the products can be delivered directly to your door via registered air mail.
- The email mentions a willingness to remove recipients from their mailing list.

**Concerns:**
1. **Unsolicited Offer:** The email is unsolicited, raising suspicions about its legitimacy.
2. **Promoting Tobacco Products:** The advertisement of tobacco products can indicate a lack of ethical standards, especially in targeting non-smokers.
3. **Request to Click Links:** Clicking on unknown links poses security risks, potentially leading to pshing sites or malware.

I recommend not engaging with the sender. If you are not interested in their offerings, it's best to ignore the email and report it as spam to your email provider.

I hope this message finds you well. I apologize if the contents of this email do not align with your personal or business ethics.

My name is Barrister Williams Bassey, an attorney at law, representing the estates of Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo. Alhaji Gwarzo was the Chief Security Adviser to the late General Sani Abacha, the military leader of Nigeria, who passed away on June [insert date].

With the emergence of a new democratic government under the leadership of General Olusegun Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has faced severe persecution due to his previous position in the military regime. Currently, he is under house arrest, confined to his village.

The purpose of this email is to inform you of a potential business proposal that may interest you. My client has made me aware of funds deposited with a security company abroad. These funds originated from security votes allocated during his tenure as Chief Security Adviser to the then President.

Unfortunately, before the intended purchase of arms and ammunitions for the President’s personal security could be completed, the President passed away. As a result, my client has decided to retain these funds for himself, as his properties have been confiscated by the current regime. However, due to his incarceration, he is unable to travel or effect the change of possession of these funds.

I have been tasked by my client to seek a foreign partner who can assist in facilitating this change of possession. I currently possess the deposit certificate and the necessary codes for executing this endeavor.

The funds in question amount to USD 33,600,000 (Thirty-Three Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).

If this proposition is of interest to you, please respond to this email so we can discuss the details further.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Barrister Williams Bassey, JP

For example, if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro for about $299, you get the serial, the CD, the box, and the manual.

parents of 15 - year old - find $ 71 , 000 cash hidden in his closet !

does this headline look familiar ? of course it does . you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( usa ) . and reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - new zealand ) . his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15 - year - old sons closet . nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . five - dollar bills , twenties , fifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber - banded in labelled piles .

"" my first thought was that he had robbed a bank "" , says the 41 - year - old woman , "" there was over $ 71 , 000 dollars in that bag - - that ' s more than my husband earns in a year "" . the woman immediately called her husband at the car - dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet .

as it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via e - mail , a type of "" report "" to e - mail addresses that he obtained off the internet . everyday after school for the past 2 months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom .

"" i just got the e - mail one day and i figured what the heck , i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out "" , says the clever 15 - year - old .

the e - mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one $ 5 dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list .

the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five - dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5 - address list . "" i get junk e - mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work "" , the boy continues .

within the first few days of sending out the e - mail , the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video - game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ 5 bills .

"" about a week later i rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it . there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . i thought i was in trouble or something ( laughs ) "" . he goes on , "" i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all "" . over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the e - mail . "" the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework "" . he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ 5 bills for twenties , fifties and hundreds .

"" i didn ' t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack . i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but i just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . "" surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . the reporting news team examined and investigated the so - called "" chain - letter "" the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain - letter at all . in fact , it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws , title 18 , section 1302 and 1341 , or title 18 , section 3005 in the us code , also in the code of federal regulations , volume 16 , sections 255 and 436 , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received .

every five - dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , "" please send me report number xyx "" . this simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( a report on how - to ) for a five - dollar fee .

[ this is the end of the media release . if you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ 71 , 000 - please continue reading . what appears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - you can use it too - just follow the simple instructions ] .

452,452,spam,"We are desperately looking for 100 lazy people who wish to make lots of money without working. We are not looking for people who are self-motivated. We are not looking for people who join every 'get rich quick' scheme offered on the Internet. We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful people, career builders, or even college graduates. We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.

We want the laziest people that exist—the guys and gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger. We want the people who stay in bed until noon. We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.

If you meet these criteria, go to: livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com and type in the Subject Line the following words: ""I do not want to work."" In fact, if you are so lazy that typing those words in the Subject line is an effort, then don't bother. Just click on the email and we'll know that you want us to send you the domain name anyhow, because then we will be absolutely certain that you are the kind of person we want.

In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want the kind of people who DO NOT take risks. If you are the kind of person who will consider doing something that's NOT a 'sure thing,' then do NOT respond. This is too easy a way to make money, and there's no challenge in it. If you can get to the website that we are going to email you, you will be able to see the first home business in history that requires no work. NONE.

By clicking on this email and then going to this website, you will be telling us that you want to make enough money that you can quit your regular job and sleep all day. We are not looking for a commitment from you, and we don't even want your money. As a matter of fact, we don't even want you to hear from us again if the idea of making lots of money without working does not interest you.

So this is the first and last email we will ever send you. That is a promise. So if nothing else, remember this - to make money without working for it just send an email with the following words in the subject line: ""I do not want to work"" to: livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com and we will email you back with the website that gives you information on the best of both worlds - a way to make money without having to work.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Grant Seeker,

You qualify for at least **$10,000** in free grants money guaranteed! Each day, over one million dollars in free government grants is given away to people just like you for a wide variety of business and personal needs. 

In a moment, I’ll tell you exactly how and where to get these grants. This money has to be given away; why not to you? You may be thinking, ""How can I get some of this free grants money?"" Let me assure you, it's not impossible! Ordinary people and businesses all across the United States are receiving millions of dollars from these government and private foundations every day.

**Who can apply?** Anyone can apply for a grant from **18 years old and up**. Grants from **$5,000 to $500,000** are possible. Grants don’t have to be paid back ever! Claim your slice of the free American pie. This money is not a loan. Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be time-consuming and require a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you’ve been denied. These government agencies don’t operate under the same stringent requirements as banks do. 

You decide how much money you need as long as it’s a lawful amount and meets the government agencies' criteria; the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid. This money is non-taxable and interest-free. None of these programs require a credit check, collateral, security deposits, or co-signers. You can apply even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit; it doesn’t matter. 

As a taxpayer and U.S. citizen, you are entitled to this money. There are currently over **1,000 federal programs, 500 state programs, 2,000 private foundations, and 800 scholarship programs** available this year. Over **$10 billion** in free personal and business government grants will be given away by government grants agencies.

**Government Grants Facts:**
- Over **10 million** people get government money every year.
- **2,000 entrepreneurs** get money to start or expand a business.
- **1,500 people** get money to invest in real estate.
- **3,000 people** get money to go to college.
- **2,500 people** get free help and training for a better job.

**Getting Business Grants:**
Anyone thinking about starting their own business or wanting to expand an existing business should rush to the world’s largest one-stop money shop where free business grants to start or expand a business are being held for you by the federal government. 

It sounds incredible that people living right here in the United States wouldn’t know that each year the world’s largest source of free business help delivers over **$50 billion** in free business grants and low-interest loans, over **$500 billion** in procurement contracts, and over **$10 billion** in free consulting and research grants.

With an unpredictable economy and a need for greater economic development, the federal government is more willing than ever to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your own boss. 

Most people never apply for free business grants because they feel it isn’t for them, think there’s too much red tape, or simply don’t know who to contact. The fact is, people from all walks of life do receive free grants money and other benefits from the government, and you should too!

**Government Grants for Personal Needs:**
- Help to buy a new home for low-income families
- Repair your home
- Rent/mortgage payments
- Utility bills
- Purchase a new car
- Groceries
- Childcare
- Fuel
- General living expenses
- Academic tutoring
- Legal services

If you or someone you know suffered a fire loss, there are programs available to help replace necessities.

**Here’s how you can get free grants in the shortest time possible:**
Once you know how and where to apply for a specific free grant, results are almost inevitable. The government wants to give away this money; it is under congressional mandate to do so. All that’s required from you is the proper presentation of your grant request.

**Announcing the Complete Guide to Government Grants:**
Forget everything you’ve seen or heard about government grants. I’ve put together a complete blueprint for researching, locating, and obtaining government grants. The Complete Guide to Government Grants is the most comprehensive tool for obtaining free grant money, available in an electronic book format, meaning you can download it and start using it minutes after you order.

In the guide, you’ll find:
- Step-by-step guidelines to applying for government grants
- Direct access to **2,000 grant, loan, and assistance programs** offered by the U.S. federal government
- Resources for state-specific grant programs
- Government funding programs for small businesses
- Guidelines for locating grants for starting or expanding a business

If you’re an American citizen or resident, you are entitled to free grant money ranging from **$1,000 to $1 million or more**. 

**Money-Back Guarantee:**
We are so confident in our grants guide that if you have not received at least **$10,000** in free grant money or if you are unhappy with our eBook for any reason within the next **60 days**, just send the eBook back, and we will refund your entire payment—no questions asked!

Order now, and if for any reason you aren’t completely satisfied, you can cancel for an immediate refund of your purchase price. You simply can’t lose!

I’m the president of a leading internet-based information business, with over **20 years** of experience in obtaining grants and helping small businesses.

He, old boy! You are forgetting Poniatowski's Red Lancers, the Cuirassiers, the Dragoons, and the whole boiling. Whenever Napoleon grew tired of seeing his battalions gain no ground towards the end of a victory, he would say to Murat, ""Here, you! Cut them in two for me!""

And so we set out first at a trot, then at a gallop—one, two!—and cut a way clean through the ranks of the enemy; it was like slicing an apple in two with a knife. Why, a charge of cavalry is nothing more nor less than a column of cannonballs.

""No, no!"" Mrs. Mallet cried. ""To bring him back voluntarily, that he may face his trial like a man!""

Mr. Batchgrew, for the second time that morning, found himself unequal to the situation and turned foolishly to the wardrobe, clearing his throat and snorting. She took Madame Hulot's hand and, before the lady could do anything to hinder her, she kissed it respectfully, even humbling herself to bend one knee. Then she rose, as proud as when she stood on the stage in the part of Mathilde, and rang the bell.

Do you ever wish you could easily call people you know in other countries
for up to 85% less than standard call prices?! And then to make these savings
without having to subscribe to any low cost calling service?! We have now
launched a product that does exactly that!

You can now call people in most popular destinations around the world for
only 33 cents per minute! There are no hidden charges, you do not need to
signup, use any credit cards, or pay any extra bills! You can try this
service at no risk and choose to use it with no commitment!

To use this new service, simply dial our access number 1530 927 055 and
once connected, dial the actual international number you wish to call.

For more information and the current list of countries you can call, 
please check our website http://www.ireland.pd-dial.com/

Example: If you wanted to call a German number 0567 123 124 you would:

2) Wait until you connect to our system and hear a message asking you
   to dial the number you wish to call.
3) Dial the full international number starting 00. In this instance 00
   (for international) 49 (country code for Germany) 567 123 124 (their
   number without the initial zero)

You will only pay 33 cents per minute to access our system with no further

cheap international calls from mobiles too! However please check the
costs of calling 1530 numbers from your mobile if you are unsure.

You only ever pay for the cost of calling our access number which will
appear on your normal bill. However any international calls you make will
not appear on your bill, so you only ever pay 33 cents per minute when
using our service!

If calling from a mobile, please ensure that you do not press the green/send
key again after dialling the actual mobile number, or you will be billed
for a second call by your mobile operator.

I've now made a sub-package of alsa-driver called ""alsa-kernel"" which contains only the kernel modules, and alsa-driver contains everything else from the original package (device entries, include files and docs).

This should allow installation of a single ""alsa-driver"" package and multiple ""alsa-kernel"" if you have more than one kernel installed. Right now the dependencies make it mandatory to have kernels installed through rpm... people who install from source can still install the ALSA modules from the source though ;-)

The devices are there now, thank Gordon for reporting the problem (and as I said, you were the only one). Any further comments are very welcome!

Download : http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/ New spec : http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec

If you aren't running kernel-2.4.18-10 for i686, simply --rebuild the alsa-driver source rpm and you'll get a package for your running kernel.

On the 12th, there is a sale to Aquila on the header system for 10,000. I think we were supplying it with AEC. For whatever reason, I had the AEC 10.0 @ #11230 into MidCon, which isn't right because there was no market for it, and MidCon wasn’t looking for it. But the Aquila deal was at #700 on WGR (Aquila). So I went ahead and changed the AEC ticket to match up with the Aquila deal. Let me know if you think it is incorrect.

496,496,ham,"Almost all NICs load firmware blobs. It's in dmesg somewhere. When the firmware doesn't load you get something like this in dmesg:

eth1: RTL8168d/8111d at 0xffffc90000c4e000,xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
, XID 083000c0 IRQ 32 eth1: unable to apply firmware patch

That's a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the 2.6.32-trunk upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob.

I can't find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load. Here's what it looks like for Intel 8255X using the e100 driver, with the firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel:

e100 0000:00:0d.0: firmware: using built-in firmware e100/d101m_ucode.bin

""built-in"" signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel at compile time. I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem. It only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image. And I use the vanilla kernel.org sources to avoid any Debian ""non-free"" issues.

Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob. There are, IIRC, 3 ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel. This applies to all devices that require soft firmware, not just NICs:

Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel
Compile the individual blob into the driver, use initrd
Put firmware file in root filesystem, tell kernel the path
#3 won't work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as block device drivers. Those require method 1 or 2. NICs should be able to use 1-3.

There are 3 different dmesg statements and 3 different errors depending on which method 1-3 above that you're using.

At least a couple of people on this list went out and bought non-RealTek PCI NICs to fix the problem instead of reverting to the older kernel.

I sort of remember that.

Yeah, I just pulled the mails. One upgraded to 2.6.32-trunk on his firewall, bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an Intel e100 IIRC. They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email. The other had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason. I can't recall how they fixed that one. IIRC the OP didn't swap hardware to achieve the fix, so they did something with the kernel/driver/firmware.

I'm not surprised. Since I'm only connected to a small 100Mbps LAN which then connects to a 12Mbps cable modem, it doesn't really affect me.

Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip. I bet you get 1/3rd wire speed at best, about 30MB/s, if even that. The machines themselves need to be modern to saturate the link--no slow CPUs or disks. Any ~2GHz CPU with 512MB RAM and a decent 7.2K RPM SATA disk should be able to push/pull 50MB/s across the wire. For that matter, eliminate the disk by creating a 200MB RAM disk on each machine. Create a test file with dd and FTP/SCP it back and forth between the RAM disks. If your RTL chip can peak the wire it'll be a 2-3 second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up to the task.

Maybe if I ever get .32 or .33 I'll squeal in anger. Until then...

It's looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the trunk kernel. You may get lucky. Then again, if you roll your own and put the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do, you shouldn't have a problem. That is, if the Debian kernel source doesn't have the blob ripped out for being ""non-free"".

You mentioned you had problems building 2.6.32 and .33 kernel source. Do you use the Debian kernel source or kernel.org source? I've been using the kernel.org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems with it (knocks on wood). I had a build problem with .33 a while back but that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine in this warmer weather. ;)

Hi All, The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to ~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity

Unusual - 8 n 1 is more common.

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this may vary from modem to modem.

To start, I installed the bare minimum Debian system for compiling programs.

Next I built a custom kernel, since most CPU optimizations are best suited to the kernel code.

Next I built X4.2.0 from sources, especially since X make a lot of use of matrixes and can also benefit from MMX optimizations. Since the first build, I've been encouraged to play with the CVS of both XFree86 and the DRI stuff, so I will be re-building X once we get some bugs worked out.

Finally I built KDE3.0BETA1 from sources I had, again to take full advantage of the MMX processor.

Can anyone recommend other minimum tools that I should re-build to get even more improvements in system performance? I know that not all packages can, or do benefit from being built on PentiumMMX rather than the i386 that Debian compiles to, but have I covered everything that CAN benefit?

I am wondering if the C, and other libraries should be re-built? Can they take advantage of the Pentium and MMX instructions for system performance? And would this require re-building gcc as well?

I realise that not everything can benefit from re-compiling. I.E. I doubt I would see much system improvement if I re-compile bash, but things like the kernel, X, and KDE should improve performance.

On a related note, I know I've mentioned here before, but I'm still looking for a Slot 1 550Mhz PIII. My regular system is a Dual PII350 and the 440BX M/B can take PIII's. I managed to get my hands on one. If I could get another I could put the two PIII's into this box and re-compile X to use the SSE/Katmai instructions in the PIII. I just don't think it is worth replacing two PII's with one PIII. I know that they are out-of-stock, and I do watch the Buy-N-Sell regularly, but short of buying a full PIII system, I've not had much luck.

Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary ""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car a few years back.I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.
Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left. Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there"" isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and the US.As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or imagined property rights are this afternoon. The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent"" transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real* interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and groom action figures sold separately, of course.Cheers,

Executive Summary:

An announcement regarding the first wave of long-term contracts (including pricing and terms) might be made today.
The risk of bankruptcy is decreasing as Davis devises a plan to 1) pass on court-ordered rate increases and 2) issue revenue bonds.
Audit results raise concerns about the funds transferred to parent companies. Davis is expected to use the threat of ""endless appeals"" and a potential November ballot initiative to pressure parent companies to contribute towards utility debt and limit rate hikes.
Davis hopes a court ruling favoring the utilities will provide political cover for passing rate hikes to California consumers and avoid bankruptcy.
Legislation and Bailout:

Bill ABLX was discussed in the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday. Issues remain regarding the tiered rate structure, especially for communities with harsh climates, but the bill has broad support and is expected to pass today. Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance, supports the bill and plans to sign it.
Bill ABL8X was not discussed in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be addressed today. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) testified that it has exhausted $400 million and is spending $45 million per day in the spot market to buy power.
Sources close to Governor Davis indicate that the ongoing court battle presents an opportunity for a settlement. Davis believes that while consumers will likely face higher electricity charges, he plans to use the threat of appeals and potential ballot initiatives to limit rate hikes.
A proposal to exempt low-income and small consumers from rate increases while increasing rates for those using more than 130% of baseline usage is gaining traction in Sacramento. This plan would impact about half of all consumers and is seen as a politically progressive move.
A minor crisis emerged when PG&E admitted to estimating bills rather than reading meters, which consumer advocates criticized as a tactic to charge more despite efforts by Californians to reduce consumption.
Long-Term Contracts:

Negotiations for the first wave of long-term power contracts initiated by Davis are nearing completion. Initial proposals have been positive, and the strategy involves announcing favorable contracts first to leverage better terms from other bidders.
Bankruptcy:

Market confidence is improving that California will avoid bankruptcy for SoCal Edison and PG&E, even though they are missing payments to creditors today. The upcoming court case is expected to provide political cover for a settlement by mid-February.
Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives:

Recent audits reveal that SoCal Edison and PG&E misused funds and failed to react to early warnings of the energy crisis. These audits highlight serious issues that could fuel a successful ballot initiative to return electricity generation under state control.
Governor Gray Davis is navigating a complex situation to address the crisis while avoiding a backlash from voters and preventing a disruptive ballot initiative.
Court Battle:

The court is likely to grant the utilities $12.7 billion in relief, which could lead to a 30% increase in consumer bills. This ruling might provide the necessary political cover for higher rates but also raises concerns about the impact on consumers and investor confidence.
Utilities are preparing for potential bankruptcy but are negotiating aggressively to influence the final bailout terms. State officials are considering tactics to delay payments and prolong legal battles to pressure utilities into a settlement.

It’s August and Big Cats Are on the Prowl
By Alan Hamilton

Round up the sheep, pull on the gauntlets, oil the shotgun— the British countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fenn tigers, and other big, vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday, including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills, and hair samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike.

Sightings have reached record levels in [NUMBER], according to Daniel Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past [NUMBER] months has received more than [NUMBER] reports of big cat sightings. ""During the first six months, we have seen an incredible amount of big cat activity. We have now had reports in every single county. The response from the public has been fantastic,"" Mr. Bamping said. ""Big cats in Britain are real, they are out there, they are breeding, and there are more of them.""

Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark Fraser, who heads the society’s Scottish arm, said lynx are now present in the Scottish countryside. ""I believe they are established and breeding. I don’t want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness, and the Borders.""

Next month, the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand was cut by a creature the size of a Labrador dog, except that it had black hairy tufts on the tips of its ears.

The society is taking the sightings seriously and plans to set up a network of trigger cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the beasts, which it will then present to the government. It is not, however, clear on what it wants the government to do about it all; throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002

The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. Experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific virus ever.

Some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances—they can carry other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

Hi!
Is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not to have sent the mail to insert it then?

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components, replcomps, forwcomps and so on). That way you get them when you are editing your message. Also, by using comps files for specific folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks). See the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now. I load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, e.g., to ""syntax"" color-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an email. It would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs... somewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square, and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Hi Conor,

To check if your cron job ran successfully, you should look at the cron log files. The location of these logs can vary depending on your system configuration. Typically, cron logs are found in:

/var/log/cron.log
/var/log/cron
/var/log/syslog
You can verify the exact location by checking your /etc/syslog.conf file.

If your system is configured to send email notifications, any output from the cron job, including errors, should be mailed to the root user. Make sure to check the mail for any reports.

Additionally, reviewing the logs will help you confirm whether the backup job executed as expected.

It would be more prudent to start with a conservative approach to the Habeas scoring. Initially assigning it a zero score and placing it in the 70_cvs_rules_under_test category would allow us to evaluate its effectiveness based on actual data rather than promises. This way, we can avoid giving spammers an easy route into inboxes until we have solid evidence that the system works.

Currently, my corpus does not contain any messages with a Habeas mark, whether spam or non-spam. Given this lack of evidence, it does not seem compelling enough to warrant a higher score. Similar rules with identical statistics are being removed from SpamAssassin, and I see no reason to treat Habeas differently.

533,533,ham,"Hi Don,

It looks like you’re encountering a few compilation issues with SpamAssassin. Here’s a quick rundown of the errors you mentioned and some suggestions for resolving them:

Error with in_addr_t Declaration:

Issue: The in_addr_t type seems to be causing a problem due to conflicting or redundant declarations.
Solution: Ensure that you’re using compatible versions of your compiler and system headers. Sometimes, explicitly including the right headers in your source code can resolve these issues. You might need to include <sys/types.h> before including other headers that use in_addr_t.
Warnings About Pointer Type Mismatches:

Issue: Warnings regarding type mismatches between char and unsigned char pointers indicate that there’s a discrepancy in how types are expected versus how they’re used.
Solution: To resolve these warnings, you should modify the function signatures or type declarations to match the expected types. For example, if full_read expects an unsigned char*, make sure that msg_buf is of type unsigned char*.
General Tips:

Check Compiler Version: Make sure your compiler version is compatible with the version of SpamAssassin you’re trying to compile. Sometimes using a newer or older compiler can resolve such issues.
Review Dependencies: Ensure that all required libraries and dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
Consult Documentation: Refer to SpamAssassin’s official installation documentation or README files for any specific instructions related to your platform.
If you continue to face issues, consider reaching out to the SpamAssassin mailing list with the details of your setup and errors. The community might offer more specific advice based on the exact version and environment you’re using.

Best of luck with your installation!

I understand the challenges you're facing with managing mailing lists. It seems like you’re grappling with the limitations of various tools.

Here's a brief overview of the options you mentioned:

Mailman: Despite its issues, Mailman is quite robust and widely used. It might be worth revisiting its documentation or seeking community support to address specific pain points.

Ezmlm: While it’s powerful, its complexity and user interface might not suit everyone. It’s definitely a choice if you're up for a challenge.

Majordomo: As you noted, Majordomo has seen little recent development. Its features are solid but might be outdated compared to more modern solutions.

SmartList: This is known for being complex to configure but can be powerful once set up.

Given these options, Mailman remains a strong candidate due to its wide adoption and active community. If you’re looking for alternatives with modern features and ease of use, consider looking into newer tools or services that have emerged recently.

Feel free to reach out if you need any further advice or assistance with your mailing list management!

Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.

My concern is not about the intention behind your business model but rather the lack of empirical evidence that the system will effectively reduce the volume of uncaught spam.

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward without any legal hassles.

I understand the motivation to pursue spammers, but this does not directly translate into a decrease in spam reaching my inbox. The effect might be indirect and potentially insufficient to counteract how easily a -20 score on the mark allows spam to avoid detection.

Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation. If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release. But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.

I believe I have a good understanding of how to localize a score in SpamAssassin. My hesitation is in using SpamAssassin to promote your business at the potential cost to our users.

It would be more prudent to start Habeas with a less aggressive score. We should observe its effectiveness before considering any increase in its scoring magnitude.

The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.

ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this advertisement, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.

The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.

Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.

The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.

David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.

Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

 normal, the third beta was out last week.

 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

 Though many say ""RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish"" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

Confused me a bit at first... (luckily it is still modal relative to the kmail window, so the kmail composer gets greyed out, indicating that the pinentry might be somewhere...)

Mostly everything related to KDE is experimental or qt-kde repository. pinentry-qt4 is 0.8.0-1.

I believe this is new pinentry-qt4 to blame rather than KDE SC 4.4.

Seconded. I saw this behavior after I upgraded to pinentry-qt4 0.8.0-1 today. I used KDE 4.4.2-0rc1 packages before and do not think that the upgrade to 4.4.2-1 made any significant difference regarding pinentry-qt4 behavior.

565,565,ham,"I was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists, plus you also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of both spam and nonspam, then you have it apply the algorithm above to the incoming mail stream. So it could be thousands of actual real, different, emails per day. The ""very high rate triggers alarms"" thing is certainly something which would be possible to check for, but there may be legitimate ways to exhibit this behavior -- can't think of one right now but ""AOL proxy server"" springs to mind as an example from another domain. If there is a maximum trust value (if trust is some sort of percentage for instance), and if it isn't impossible to reach it, that would prevent too few people to get too much of an advantage. My guess is if 1% of razor users can reach this limit (or be near enough), spammers won't be able to cheat just by building up their trust, they would need a fair amount of fake users too. Now, for the ""fair amount of fake users"", spammers don't have access to many set of network classes. So they would need a bunch of users coming from the same set of ips. If the razor servers see 100 people on a class C network (253 ips) reporting 10000 emails a day, something wrong is going on. This could also trigger alarms. As for legitimate proxies and the like, 1) a proxy should not report anything (spam should be reported by hand, not automatically), 2) there may be a way to have exceptions (IBM networks would have lots of users from the same set of ips but no likely spammers, so no alarm would trigger for their network, or better the alarm would be less sensitive). AOL could still give trouble though but even then, for one particular phone line/cable, the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class C (using network subclassing). The spammers could still try to have several connections at different locations, but that increases their cost and so is not so much interesting.

Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of the atmosphere trails off.

Chemistry types have a method for dealing with this question without dragging in the calculus:

Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly affected by gravity, resulting in the potential energy for a mass M to be linear in height h: Mgh. What relative concentrations will we have when two different packets of air are in equilibrium? If they are at the same height, we will have half the mass in one, and half the mass in the other, and the amount flowing from one to the other balances the amount flowing in the opposite direction.

If they are at differing heights, then a greater percentage of the higher air tends to descend than that percentage of the lower air which ascends. In order for the two flows to balance, the higher packet must contain less air than the lower, and the mass balance of the flows corresponds thusly:

High percentage of thin air
Low percentage of dense air
Now, rates are exponential in energy differences, so that theoretically we should expect an exponential decay in height, to compensate. How does it go in practice?

**AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks**  
If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires, you could try some of the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.  

According to a *Details* magazine story cited in the *New York Post*, ""the No. 1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on [New York's] Upper East Side.""  

""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store on Madison Avenue,"" which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the magazine's October issue says.  

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women — or rather, women who are loaded.  

""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA spokesman told *The Post*.

one of those shells on the #! line.

589,589,ham,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it as a filter.A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe marshalling.)- Your idea here.Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl

Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task. The specification is huge and clients do all kinds of weird stuff. POP is very easy in comparison. Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives. Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client that could be used to review additions to the training set. Each day a few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates. Someone would periodically start up the client, review the candidates, reclassify or remove any messages they don't like, and add them to the training set.

My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.

Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing
be ""My Last Sony""?

What ""long, rude, unpleasant emails"" have I sent to you? Go ahead, post everything that I've ever sent to you here. I've sent mails only as long as the demands of your comments have warranted, filled only with questions about what is broken for you in KDE 4 and links to bugs on those very subjects. Rude or unpleasant? I think that you have me mistaken. I'll give to you the benefit of the doubt, publish something that you think I wrote to you which is rude or unpleasant.

> That is what I am complaining about. As I said above, *I* have been getting them from Dotan, as you correctly state: ""*Lisi* shreef ..... *I* have been getting them."" According to list policy I should not be getting them. In addition, the last one was sent to the KDE list (to which I do not subscribe) and not to this, which is the list with the thread.

Perhaps you should read Dotan's last two emails to me (especially the last one) before complaining about my complaint.

> And my crime?? For which you too clearly feel that I should be subjected to the unpleasant bullying in emails direct to me? I use KDE 3, but do not intend to use KDE 4.

All I did was ask about what issues you have with KDE 4 so that I might fix them. You don't have to appreciate that, but I do not expect you to turn it around and call that ""rude and unpleasant."" Maybe you don't like KDE contributors taking an interest in your problems with the software. Many other people do.

=================================  
What's Hot in the World of DivX(tm) Video This Week:  
Battle of the Planets in DivX, Warcraft III, and the Latest Skins  
Now Sent to Over 1.6 Million DivX Fans Worldwide!

Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of DivX video.

(You are being sent this email because you subscribed to this newsletter at DivX.com. If you'd like to unsubscribe, follow the instructions at the end of this message.)

**In This Week's Issue**  
--------------------  

1. Classic Battle of the Planets in DivX Video  
2. Warcraft III with DivX Video Sells like Hotcakes  
3. Skins, Skins and More Skins

**Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!**  
------------------------------------  

One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great way to get their content in front of new audiences.

A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late 1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase, and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets episodes to come.

* Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the DivX Showcase:  
<http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/showcase/detail.php?id=52>

**Warcraft III Sets Sales Records**  
-------------------------------  

A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July, Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite games in the near future....

**The Latest DivX Player Skins**  
----------------------------  

Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're just not cool.

* DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by ""DIVX Budman.""  
<http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/skins/detail.php?id=72>

* Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness. Submitted by ""gryphix.""  
<http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/skins/detail.php?id=71>

* DVDesque: As the title suggests, this skin has a groovy DVD-player design to complement the DivX experience. Submitted by ""NellyNel.""

631,631,ham,"Engineering Meetings in Broomfield, CO on March 9 and 10

Hi Stinson,

As per our discussion, which we will expand upon when we meet later today, my current role in Hamachi is better characterized as a combination of deal support (from the engineering perspective), facilitating my work with Jean Mrha (via Erik Simpson) on the initial load forecast and general requirements document development. None of this is technical by any means. If anything, it is more like engineering consulting (from the deal perspective) by EBS research to John’s group.

I will bring it up with John tomorrow night about bringing our technical guys on such road trips so that they can get involved with his group, even though no optimization modeling work may need to be done. For this, I will use Samer and/or Chonawee, but we need to be certain that they are available on such an on-call basis as stated below. John is very clear and specific about who he asks to be at such meetings and when, etc. Normally, he does not want any deviations. So if we put someone on such jobs, they have to be able to travel on-call, anywhere, any place. That is the time pressure he is working with.

He wants me to be the primary contact for such deal support effort, but I will ask to bring along our technical guys on such trips so that they are plugged in, etc. I will recommend this to John for the next deal that he is planning.

To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing enron america's velocity of capital and associated return on invested capital, we have decided to create a capital book. the capital book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by joe deffner. the purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within enron americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.

the previous numbers used in the business plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating business unit subject to the internal ownership policy outlined below.

the cost of capital associated with all transactions in enron americas will be set by joe. this process is separate and apart from the current rac process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on enron america's overall credit capacity.

on transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the capital book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the credit group takes a credit reserve. this finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. as noted above, the capital book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

by sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, enron america's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.

questions regarding the capital book can be addressed to:

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our final specifications for modeling data requirements need to be as follows:

We need bankrupt, default, and non-default (which covers non-bankrupt) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months of performance following the latest snapshot. Monthly performance indicators need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period. We will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and a comparable sample of good accounts with weights.

For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with the above specs covering 16 months of performance. This means that we will need rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots performance

1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end
12 month end performance for January 2000 through December 2000
1999 February end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end

12 month end performance for December 1999 through November 2000
1999 January end, 1999 April end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end

12 month end performance for November 1999 through October 2000
1998 December end, 1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end

12 month end performance for October 1999 through September 2000
We will need bankruptcy chapter-wise indicators, if available, during the performance period. Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ days delinquency on any trade credit.

We have also discussed the cost aspect, and we think considering the big picture, it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis.

Please let me know your thoughts. This will require D&B to give us a modified quote, and we could possibly move forward quickly.

648,648,ham,"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. 

The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.

So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))I think I'll use this ""--with "" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)MatthiasPS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)--

**HELP.**  
I had GPG working.  
I updated from version `gnupg-1.0.6` to `gnupg-1.0.7`.  
This moved `gpg` from `/usr/bin` to `/usr/local/bin` and I changed the path in the exmh 'executable'.

With that fix, EXMH knows I have GPG, and puts the line:

```
Check the signature with GnuPG
```

in messages with GnuPG signatures. But punching the line ALWAYS gives:

```
Signature made Thu Aug 29 00:27:17 2002 MDT using DSA key ID BDDF997A
Can't check signature: public key not found
```

So, something else is missing.  
Can somebody tell me what it is?  
I've tried grepping on everything that I can think of with no luck at all.

In my experience it's probably better to use an external database 
(MySQL) with amarok because it's faster to load. Anyhow, it still 
happens that the changes you make to the tracks/albums don't show 
immediately in the database. Bye

667,667,ham," Monthly Charges for Analysts on Your RC Report

I wanted to let all of you know how you will be charged for analysts if you currently have or will have one in your RC for the year 2000. The analyst program is being handled differently than it was in 1999. In addition to the normal salary, benefits, and payroll taxes, you will also be charged an overhead administration fee for the program. You will be charged the following monthly amounts for each analyst in the detail class code that I have indicated below:

**Detail Class Description** | **Amount**
--- | ---
Salaries and Wages | $4,000
Benefits | $774
Payroll Taxes | $360
Corporate Services | $1,266
**Total Monthly Cost** | **$6,400**

The $4,000 amount represents an average of all analyst salaries and does not indicate what the analyst in your RC is paid. This amount will not change in February as the $4,000 already includes merit raise information for 2000. The $1,266 represents the overhead costs of administering the program, including campus recruiting and office visits.

When you look at your RC report, you will see a line item labeled ""A and A Reclass"" in each of the detail classes identified above. Enron North America is invoiced by Corp. for the costs of all analysts. Financial operations makes a manual journal entry each month to charge the appropriate RC. Please check your January 2000 RC report and make sure you were properly charged for the correct number of analysts you have currently. If there are any errors, please let me know as soon as possible so that I can work with Brian Heinrich to have it corrected in February. Please continue to check your RC report each month going forward. 

Thanks.

If you have any questions, please call me.

I was sufficiently intrigued by the (apparent) absence of a simple MTA
that does the above, so I decided to write my own: Tmta.  It actually
works, and is documented, although it's still pretty much in the
proof-of-concept stage:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tmta/

One important thing that it does *not* (yet?) do is fork; it's currently
implemented as a basic, single-threaded daemon, so it can only accept
one connection at a time.  It shouldn't be too difficult (famous last
words ...) to convert into a multi-threaded model, although I have no
experience with that sort of thing.

It is still small, though - under 70 lines of actual Perl code,
although it does, of course, require the basic Perl installation and
about a half-dozen other modules.

If anyone has any feedback, or suggestions for improvement, I'd love
to hear them.

By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad

Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.


The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed

Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.

The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.

It had not eaten for three weeks.

Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.

Garlanded

One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.


The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.

The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.

Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.

'Exploited'

Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.

They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.

The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.

The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

That's true.  I used to say and think that ... back around 1992 when
I started to use DEC Alpha machines.  But now that 2GB is about as
little RAM as you can get in a new machine, the push to move to 64bit is
very real.

By the logic of that article, which is apparently endorsed by at least a few FoRKers, should I keep all Americans at an arms distance for fear I'll be infected with the same paranoiac blood-lust meme-virus? After-all, it's a disease, just like a plague, right? Ok, ok, so maybe I /do/ keep a few Yanks in quarantine, fenced off with chickenwire out in the back 40, but that's besides the point. At least I feed them. Wait, wait ... enough tit-for-tat, how about a technical question: How would you /know/ if you were infected? Wouldn't the schizophrenia of the diseased meme be transparent to you, perfectly bonded into your reality?

N> People require a touch more effort. Spoken exactly like those people I do not understand, because the specist statement is patently false by /all/ measures known to science, yet they so adamantly believe the farce is truth. Would you also believe the Earth is at the center of the Universe, put here for our exclusive enjoyment because God loves us best? ""To the enlightened mind, there is no difference between a Brahmin and a dog"" --- guess which moral relativist said it and where.

717,717,ham,"I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if they're exmh issues or my setup issues.

First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0, it seems to take forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4, it starts in a snap.

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.

Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages. (When I go to next from inbox, it does go where I would think it should go).

Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting something different than I should be.

Thanks for all the effort,

The newsletter contains various updates on EFF's activities, legal cases, and notable events related to technology, civil liberties, and digital rights. Here's a summary of some of the key points:

- **Broadcast Protection Discussion Group (BPDG)**: The EFF submitted a letter to FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell, expressing concerns over the Broadcast Flag proposal, which could negatively impact innovation, competition, and consumer rights in the context of digital television (DTV).

- **Intel Corp. v. Hamidi**: EFF supported Ken Hamidi, who had emailed criticisms of Intel to employees. The case, based on the concept of ""trespass to chattels,"" raised important questions about freedom of speech and the use of internet communication.

- **DeCSS Author Jon Johansen's Trial**: The trial of Norwegian teenager Jon Johansen, who reverse-engineered DVD encryption, was postponed to December 9, 2002. His legal case involved accessing DVD content on his own device, raising questions about intellectual property and user rights.

- **Xbox Reverse Engineering**: Researcher Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang was set to present his findings on security flaws in Microsoft's Xbox system at a conference, with EFF assisting in clearing potential legal obstacles under the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act).

- **Deep Links**: Various important internet and digital rights issues were highlighted, such as Baen Books expanding its fair-use-friendly e-book program, encouraging open distribution of its content, and resisting restrictive digital rights management (DRM) practices.

This publication reflects EFF's ongoing efforts to protect digital freedoms, advocate for open access to technology, and oppose legal measures that could harm innovation and free expression.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

The ""press release"" announces a ludicrous energy services agreement between Enron and Hades, humorously valued at $666 trillion.
John D. Rockefeller, humorously portrayed as the head of Hades’ energy management division, comments on the significant heating demands of ""hell.""
Enron is depicted as a leading energy supplier willing to collaborate with Hades, making light of their business practices and corporate culture.
The piece exaggerates Hades' reach and growth, claiming millions of sites and an absurd customer base of approximately 173 quintillion.

Is it better to upgrade Debian using dist-upgrade or just download the new ISO and reinstalling it?
I'm waiting for the Squeeze final release. Currently still using Lenny.


As a KDE user, I currently know of one bug (it has been reported to the Debian maintainer). This applies to unstable or Squeeze: ""plasma-widget-yawp"" will not connect/work, regardless of the version of yawp or KDE 4. It can be reproduced by upgrading from Lenny to Squeeze or unstable, or from KDE 3 to KDE 4.

Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 

Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.

You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".

Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.

I still have to manually update all my address books by hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x address books (there's no 6.x import as they just assume it works—which it doesn't).
The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number). Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to work on something with someone remotely.
I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the source I send always get lost.

3. usage of  just like  (ie. without ) which is obsolete
   (not sure whether some mailers still produce such broken html)
4. tag argument values sometimes enclosed in """", sometimes not
5. colour args without # in front of hex rgb code
6. colour args with non-6-digit rgb code (typo)
7. onMouseOver et al in nonconsistent case throughout the document

Mind, those are just ideas. I'm pretty sure some or even most of them
are not working in practice, but they might be worth checking out.

But I have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value. It should have been 0. I understand that initially only spammy scores were included.

Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative would be non-spam. (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's choice of 5 just adds an offset.

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my “long loop” today and discovered that the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the “short loop” I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds them, can you please let me know? Thank you.

I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, “Look, another runner... not smiling!” This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a runner.

Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, then get invigorated and run another mile.

And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running thing aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and run.

There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 

*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 

*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 

Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 

*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.

Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you and Zimin. It was a great pleasure to meet with you and your team members.

I had a wonderful conversation with Zimin last week, and I provided him with my current resume. If he hasn’t forwarded it to you yet, I would be happy to send you a copy.

After our discussions and attending your presentation at UH, I am truly interested in the fields you are working on. I am deeply impressed by the research your team has conducted, and I look forward to the possibility of becoming a member of your group. I am eager to conduct research under your guidance.

I believe that your research department offers the kind of roles and environment I have been seeking for a long time. My career objectives align with your research focus and direction. I am confident that my training in mathematics and computer science will provide a solid foundation in energy risk management. Additionally, I am sure that working with you will greatly enhance my IT skills and experiences, and I look forward to learning from you and your research team.

Currently, after completing my programming work as an IT specialist, I am reading John Hull's book to strengthen my background in finance and related fields. I am also reading your book, ""Managing Energy Price Risk,"" and I appreciate you providing me with a copy.

Thank you once again for this opportunity, and I look forward to the possibility of working with your team.

Enron is exploring the possibility of participating in a research initiative called the New Economy Value Research Lab. This lab is a collaboration between MIT's Sloan School of Management and Arthur Andersen (AA) and aims to develop quantitative valuations of the intangible assets that Wall Street increasingly recognizes as vital in the new economy (Business Week, 2/7/00). As Enron transitions from a hard asset-based organization to one focused on intangible assets, accurately measuring and valuing these intangibles is becoming increasingly crucial.

Last week, Steve Kean, Vince Kaminski, Marie Hejka, and I met with a team from AA, the deputy dean of the Sloan School, and MIT's lead accounting/finance professor to discuss the lab's intent, expected outcomes, and potential involvement for Enron. Following that meeting, we decided to further explore our participation in the lab. Enron now needs to:

Define our corporate measurement and valuation process needs.
Identify value attributes important to Enron and the industries in which we operate.
Once we have defined these needs, we will schedule a follow-up meeting with MIT to determine the next steps.

Your expertise and assistance could significantly influence the inputs and outcomes of this process. Please schedule time on Tuesday, August 1, from 2:00 to 3:30 PM to attend our next meeting, where we will begin identifying our needs and defining value attributes. The location will be EB 49 C 4. Kindly notify me if you are unable to attend.

To assist with preparation for this meeting, I am attaching notes from a recently published book titled Cracking the Value Code: How Businesses are Creating Wealth in the New Economy (May 2000, Boulton, Libert, Samek - Arthur Andersen).

If you would like more information about the lab, our previous meeting, the book, or anything else, please feel free to contact me.

I look forward to meeting with you.

As you know, the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate program to develop greater talent flow into ENA. We are currently working on several initiatives to enhance this process and significantly improve communication flow and responsiveness.

To facilitate this, we need your assistance in establishing clear lines of communication within ENA regarding Analyst and Associate resource levels, performance, rotations, and retention efforts. Each of you is requested to take the lead for your group’s needs and ensure that any requests, questions, or concerns about Analysts and Associates in your area are channeled through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recruitment Team Lead - x 35275), Jana Giovannini (ENA Liaison from the AA Program - x 39233), or myself.

It is essential that we are discerning about how we allocate our Analyst and Associate resources and plan carefully for our future needs. We ask that you or a senior member of your team review any resource requests before forwarding them to us.

Additionally, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA Analyst and Associate matters. The first date will be confirmed in due course. In the meantime, if you would like to volunteer another senior member of your team to take on this responsibility, please provide their name as soon as possible.

I would like to purchase several copies of the Xpress LP Solver for the gas storage optimization model. We previously discussed acquiring CPLEX, but after trialing both systems, I've found some significant advantages with Xpress. If others find Planner/CPLEX better suited to their applications, I have no objections to their use of a different system. Both have strengths, and I may consider using Planner/CPLEX on future projects if we have both systems available.

Xpress is particularly well-suited for my application as it efficiently handles special ordered sets. This feature allows the integer search process to leverage the extra information provided by the set, rather than relying solely on binary integer variables to represent the ratchets.

It's worth noting that Planner is a C++ interface for CPLEX, but it has some significant limitations and does not provide access to all CPLEX features.

Dash Optimization has made the following offer:

All software purchases made by Enron this year will be at 30% off the list price, with no minimum purchase quantity required to obtain this discount.
90 days of full maintenance services will be included with the purchase.
The EMOSL utility will be provided at no cost.
The XBSL system will also be provided at no cost when it is released in a few weeks.
For the gas storage optimization model, I would like to purchase:

One development license (Hyper version) with Modeller, Primal/Dual Simplex, MIP Search, DLLs, EMOSL, and XBSL when available.

To: Enron North America Corp.
From: Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon

In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, we highlighted several critical objectives for the continued growth of ENA, including:

Accelerating the development of our people.
Significantly expanding our customer network and associated markets.
Enhancing information flow between groups, both within ENA and across Enron.
Consistent with these objectives and the corporate goal of fostering collaboration, we are introducing changes to the downstream and midstream coverage/origination groups.

Downstream Coverage/Origination Groups
As energy deregulation progresses in North America, the heavy industrial segment is emerging as a crucial market for both ENA and Enron Corp. To capitalize on this opportunity, we will expand our downstream coverage/origination function to include:

Pulp and Paper: Edward Ondarza will continue to manage coverage activities in this sector, focusing on innovative products and paper risk management.
Chemicals, Plastics, and Refined Products: Jim Ajello has been asked to lead this coverage group, responsible for delivering innovative solutions in these industries.
Non-Integrated Industrials: Bruce Garner, formerly with Bankers Trust’s global metals and mining group, will lead this area, focusing on metals, mining, industrial gases, and more.
Midstream Coverage/Origination Groups
Eastern Coverage/Origination: This group will concentrate on energy, finance, and power development solutions for utilities and service companies in the eastern interconnect, led by Janet Dietrich.
Western Coverage/Origination: Chris Calger will head this group, focusing on similar objectives in the western region and managing qualified facilities restructuring.
IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination: Mike Miller will lead this group, focusing on structured energy solutions for merchant power generators.
Eastern QF Restructuring: Dave Duran will manage this group, concentrating on restructuring opportunities in the eastern interconnect.
Commercial Transactions
The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff Donahue, aims to centralize transaction execution to improve efficiency and free up origination groups for increased client engagement. Key functions within CTG include:

Transaction Development
Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management
Commodity Structuring and Transportation
Transactional Support/Accounting
Technical Analysis
Upstream Asset Management
Each transaction development team will work closely with specific origination groups to enhance service and accountability.

Conclusion
We believe these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage and industry knowledge across all ENA markets, particularly in industrial sectors. Your cooperation is essential as we implement these changes and continue to build on our success in North America.

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to have you as a keynote speaker.

Given our good, long-term relationship with UT, I would recommend that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn a few times about the program, and I think that this will be an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

849,849,ham," I'm aware that maybe more publicity surrounding some and certain agencies have been granted more funding, but I'd like to see some data which shows if these are increasing or not. Why? Well, it seems to me if we were going to get hit, the one that does it may have been part of a larger swarm or cluster which has over the years increased the distance between the rocks. Like the Schumaker Levy-9, which had multiple rocks all impacting at different times, others may have this same type of design and could be in different stages of increasing distance from one another. Also to consider is if SL-9 was on course for earth, would we get hit by all rocks or only one because the earth is a much smaller target than Jupiter? So, my theory is that if these near earth rocks are increasing so does our chance of discovering the last three were part of a swarm of 15 of which 10, 11 and 12 may hit.

Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g., Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you still can't fit a lot on a CD. It's not unusual today to have gigabytes of static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best, which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard drives become cheaper.

So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static. I seem to recall an article on this (early '80s, Byte magazine, perhaps?) for BBS systems or for testing unknown (perhaps Trojan horse) software.

The FEC also suggested that such messages include either a phone number or website link, allowing people to find out who paid for the message, although this is not required. This decision could encourage the use of text-based political ads as campaign experts look for innovative ways to reach voters. However, there are concerns that this could lead to anonymous political spam.

Target Wireless, a New Jersey-based company, requested this opinion, claiming that financial disclosures would consume too much of the 160-character limit for text messages. The petition was backed by several organizations, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack mentioned that the opinion aligns with the commission's policy to avoid interfering with new technologies that can help engage voters. Nevertheless, there are concerns that this might lead to spam or allow for the dissemination of negative political messages without accountability.

The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).

The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals. ""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to push for full Senate passage before the end of the year, said.

""Nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation.""

The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.

""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the bill.

""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal.""

To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to Nanotechnology would also be established. According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in June. Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel; emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities, equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

On the Exchange server... (mail.yourdomain.com)

Create a new, private SMTP address (nomorespam@yourdomain.com) for the mailbox you want to protect. Remove the old address.
Create a ""custom recipient"" with the old SMTP address (spammedalot@yourdomain.com).
Create another custom recipient pointing at a local user on the Spamassassin box (killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com).
Set the first custom recipient to forward all mail to the second custom recipient (must forward to another address in the Exchange directory).
On the Spamassassin box... (filtermail.yourdomain.com)

Set up a dummy user, in this case ""killspam.""
Give killspam a .forward file pointing to the final recipient's new, private smtp address back on the Exchange server.
So the message flow is like this:

Mail arrives on the Exchange server mail.yourdomain.com for spammedalot@yourdomain.com
spammedalot@commonwealth.com forwards it to killspam@filtermail.yourdomain.com
Following the .forward file, the e-mail is then forwarded to nomorespam@yourdomain.com
Wowie Zowie it works. The first address I protected was myself, the second one I protected was postmaster. As you can see, you must create two custom recipients in Exchange and one dummy account with a .forward file on the spam filter box for each address you want to protect.

Like I said, it is more work, but until I am done load-testing, this is the way it will stay.

Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.

If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some
important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out
for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again
incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1). Eeeek...
I hope they aren't intending to release a new RH with a new gcc which
hasn't yet been released (again). Bad enough the first time, and I'm
sure it gave RedHat a lot of embarrassment.

FWIW, I've yet to compile apt on the gcc 3.2 snapshot in RawHide -
apt's C++ makes several rather poor assumptions on what iterators are,
and in addition doesn't use namespaces at all. For non-C++ folk, this
basically means it needs porting. I've got a reasonable way along,
now, and I'll send a suitable patch to Connectiva or somewhere when I
succeed - I can't find anything on Connectiva's site itself for this.

In addition, the rpmlib stuff has changed slightly - I've not really

I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

""I told you so."" never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

my laptop. I bought it seperately but it's also Software originally
belonging to a laptop but a different model than my own. 

Maybe this might play a role, but i'm far away from being an expert in
this items.

One can read on some Linux websites which deal with this energy saving
problem, that it makes no sense anyway to change, for example, your cpu
state in order to save battery power, i.e. that it is useless to choose
the mode ""powersave"" or ""conservative""  for saving power. On the other
side. it is likewise useless to choose the mode ""performance"" to tune
your cpu efficiency.

For me this makes sense. Modern cpu's are flexible enough to quickly
change between ""low"" and ""performance"" if needed. Modern notebook hdd's
are likewise already optimized for energy saving modes. 

But something must be different between windows and linux. Using my
windows there is indeed a different if i would set the power management
to ""performance"" or to ""powersave"". This makes nearly an hour or a half
difference in battery lifetime of my multiboot laptop! Of course this
drepends on what you do, but the difference is obvious.

Using my Debian i seldom reach a larger time span as if using windows in
""performance"" mode, in spite of it is so ""quiet"" when working with it or
when idle, and windows always is so ""restless"" as if always something
happens on the disk, some processes are running etc.

Maybe this after all has something to do with the different kernels?

There seem to be several ""boneheads"" in our class. A few months ago I 
ran into John Dahill, he asked me if I would go to the reunion picnic 
with him. His girlfriend and my guyfriend wouldn't know anyone there, 
so I said yes. Yesterday he told me he can't go!! All this time he 
thought it was on Saturday!! Oh well, I will see everyone there 
sometime through the afternoon.

And What's Coming Up Next Week in NNT Premium

01. SECURE IE.  For the past month or so, our Software Review Panel has 
been giving a grueling test to Secure IE, a piece of software that blocks 
Flash and pop-ups, prevents malicious file downloads, lets you customize 
Security Zone settings as you browse dozens of Web sites simultaneously up 
to five times faster with a tabbed interface, annotate Web page with sticky 
notes and highlighter, and save complete Web pages, even secure server 
(HTTPS) pages and archive online transaction receipts.  For what we believe 
is one of the most thorough reviews ever conducted on a single piece of 
software, check out what our Panel had to say at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/SoftwareReviews .  For a free trial download, 
visit http://www.secureie.com .  And if this one sweeps you off your feet, 
go to the NNT Store at http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store and get a super 
deal, just $17.50 if you order before September 14.  With a 30-day 
guarantee, what's to lose?

02. DISK CLEANUP ON XP.  Windows XP users can do some fast cleaning chores 
with Disk Cleanup.  Access this tool from the Start menu by right clicking 
on your hard drive.  Then select Properties and click on the Disk Cleanup 
button to determine how many files can be safely deleted.

03. THANKS BUT NO THANKS.  Continuing our periodic feature of 
less-than-useful sites on the Web:  The International Center for Bathroom 
Etiquette at http://www.icbe.org/ gets our recognition this issue.  It says 
it's working hard to bring you the latest in cutting edge research and 
technology regarding bathroom etiquette.  We'll resist some obvious puns.

. . . . .

West Virginia's Diane Stratton recommended NNT to some friends and is now 
enjoying QuicKeys 2.0, a great Windows management software package.  Diane 
is our latest winner and you could be next.  Just go to the NNT Web site at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com and click on ""Recommend NNT.""  Nothing could 
be easier.

. . . . .

04. MOUSELESS WAY HOME.  To go home quickly in Internet Explorer, touch F6 
to highlight the Address Bar and type two periods (..) there.  The Enter 
key then takes you home.

05. KARTOO.  Search engines are everywhere on the Internet but Kartoo at 
http://www.kartoo.net is quite unusual.  It's a meta search engine that 
displays results on a map in the form of a ball.  The larger the ball, the 
more relevant the result.  As you mouseover each result, site descriptions 
are revealed.  If all that sounds confusing, the explanation is more 
complicated than the service itself.  Just try it.

. . . . .

You should make it a habit to visit the NNT Store at 
http://www.NeatNetTricks.com/store . We try to have several great products 
there at a limited-time price much less than anywhere else on the Net. 
Currently, you'll find excellent ebooks, a very effective popup stopper, 
and the very useful utility described in item 01 above, along with the 
usual opportunity to subscribe to NNT Premium and ArchivesExpress.  Check 
us out, you'll be glad you did.

. . . . .

06. XP TIME FEATURE.  Windows XP added a nice feature that heretofore 
required a separate software application.  It will connect, either at a 
programmed time or manually, to a time server via the Internet and reset 
that often erroneous internal clock.  Just click on the time in the systems 
tray, go to Date and Time Properties and click the Internet Time tab.

07. LEAF PEEPER ALERT.  A bit early, but soon the changing colors of autumn 
will begin here in the U.S.  For those who like to follow the display, 
consider http://www.stormfax.com/foliage.htm for a comprehensive collection 
of links and toll-free numbers to each state to determine peak color times.

08. SAVINGS SCRAPS.  Some oldies are worth repeating.  If you're working 
with text in, for example, MS Word or WordPad, and would like a handy way 
to save a portion for later easy retrieval, just select (highlight) it and 
click/drag it to your desktop.  When the newly created icon is clicked on, 
it will show the application with which the scrap was created, along with 
the first few words of the text.  A double click opens the text in the 
application with which it was created.

09. QUICK ACCESS.  To go to a frequently used program, you may find 
yourself drilling down to the desktop and searching out the shortcut 
icon.  Consider instead setting up a key combination that will provide 
quick access without using the shortcut. Right click on the shortcut and 
select Properties.  In the Shortcut key window, select any key you can 
remember and click OK.  Ctrl+Alt and that key will open the application 
whenever needed.

   <font size=""3""><b>Why we're changing our publishing schedule</b></font>

<br><br>

Dear Reader,
<p>
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
<p>
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.  
<p>
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
<p>
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
<p>
For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works. 
<p>
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on <a href=""http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=00-4FQlI9QDB2t8PBibgi4cHr7W6TiR"" >CNET Radio</a> every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

David Coursey<br>
Executive Editor<br>
AnchorDesk

The deals have been split several times.

I was researching deal 819348 (CES - Midcon Texas Gas Services Corp) and found that it was incorrectly attached to contract 96035432 (in fact, the GTC firm had three deals attached). Since one of the deals ended 03/31/01, we won't bother correcting that one, but this deal needs to be moved. I set up contract 96061912 and attached it today. This deal still needs to be reviewed by Cyndie before the CP is inactivated.

Elizabeth, could you please revalidate this deal?
My team, could you please add this one to your daily deal count report?
Ellen, could you please reconfirm if necessary?

Thanks, all. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Man killed 'trying to surf' on Tube train 
Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious.""

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 

    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

KASHIWA, Chiba -- A man has been arrested for using his camera-equipped
mobile phone to take a photo of the inside of a schoolgirl's skirt
as she rode an escalator here, police said.

Toyokazu Hamano, 40, a company employee from Noda, Chiba Prefecture,
was arrested for breaking a Chiba Prefectural Government law
forbidding people from creating a public nuisance.

Hamano admits to the allegations.

Police said Hamano was riding behind the girl on an escalator at
JR Kashiwa Station when he took out his mobile phone, held it
underneath the girl's skirt and took a photo. The girl was alerted
to his presence by the noise emitted by the phone camera's shutter.
She turned around to catch Hamano with his hands between her legs.

956,956,ham,"Clay Shirky: In Praise of Evolvable Systems. This entire article could be rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that.

If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to design a “novelty format” to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0:

It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world.
It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user.
It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date.
Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholly resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind.
After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on.
After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers.
RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format, we have the worst one possible.

Except, of course, for all the others.

The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities—RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place.

Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger.
Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed HTML elements.
Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high-level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility.
Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to “do RSS right”—most notably RSS 1.0 in the year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits:

Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced.
Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise of better tools, it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 feed—in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world—by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form.
Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be flourishing.

959,959,ham,"Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail' 

By ROBERT BURNS
AP Military Writer 



WASHINGTON (AP)--The military command responsible for the defense of North
American airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports
of an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the Caribbean to
the United States, defense officials said Thursday. 

Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened
Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., was continuing to investigate. 

The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it
could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or
approaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. 

A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold
air. 

The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source
of the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD
spokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial
report at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking
radars in search of evidence, he said. 

A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what
appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of
the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. 

``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United
States,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the
contrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings
were reported.'' 

The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the
Pentagon statement said. 

At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm
aware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. 

Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the
Caribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or
from which military bases they were scrambled. 

``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to
investigate'' a contrail, he said. 

Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday
had people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations
with calls reporting a meteor shower. 

It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,
Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian
rocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

(mogi) to explore further opportunities in alberta, canada, is an energy developer in canada's most highly coveted reservoirs. aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oil and gas again this morning! montana oil and gas inc. (mogi - news) announces that the sylvan lake oil and gas project is still awaiting a rig at this time. the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become available for over two weeks, and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest. the company has a 25% working interest in the sylvan lake project.

symbol - mogi
current price - .26

reasons to consider mogi:

price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bull market in a generation.
natural gas prices have tripled in the last two years.
with multiple projects in high gear and the expanding production on reserves potentially worth multi-millions, mogi is selling for less than 1/4 the value of its assets.
montana oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitable enterprises. already shares in the oil and gas sector are rising faster than the overall market. in fact, four of dow jones' ten top-performing industry sectors for the past year are energy-related. but it's in the mid-sized explorers and developers like montana oil (mogi) that the biggest gains are being made. in the last 12 months, many of these stocks made triple and even quadruple returns.
breaking news!!
april 29, - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project. after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta, the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the 5-3-38-3 w 5 m well. the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately thereafter. the company's west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie-in upon lifting of the road ban. with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description.

project history
the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950s and has produced over 40 million barrels (mbbls) of high-quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet (bcf) of associated natural gas, predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations. the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics. the original freehold lease on section 3-38-3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company, as was most of the sylvan lake field itself. an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in 7-3-38-3 w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting. as a consequence, the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights (below the base of the jurassic formations) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960s. this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically, not often by the major companies. accordingly, these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee. through diligent land work (including field visits) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3. since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres (one quarter section) of section 3. energy 51 has the right to earn 50% of this prospect (possibly 75%) with the drilling of a test well in 5-3-38-3 w 5 m.

land discussion
our partners have secured a 100% working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3-38-3 w 5 m. the land comprises some 480 acres (one section or one square mile equals 640 acres). primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows; one quarter section spacing (160 acres) for oil and one section spacing (640 acres) for natural gas. the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units (called holdings) should you be able to prove to the province's satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density. almost the entire sylvan lake field, pekisko pool, has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well.

1007,1007,ham,"As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter, Enron’s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue to experience tremendous growth. The opportunities to continue to grow our natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical to Enron’s future success that we remain focused on expanding these businesses and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside of gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnings growth. We have made significant progress in developing these businesses in North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit.

Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products, coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credit trading, paper and pulp, and metals. While significant progress has been made in these efforts, we need to accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North America and Europe.

In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize on the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses, we are today announcing the formation of a new business unit – Enron Global Markets. This new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets. This new core business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer. They will report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets. Mark, Mike, and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:

Global Crude and Products: John Nowlan
Coal: George McClellan
Currency, Equities, Interest Rate and Agricultural Trading: Gary Hickerson
Insurance and Weather: Jere Overdyke
Enron’s metals business and EnronCredit.com will remain the responsibility of Enron Europe. The paper and pulp business will continue to reside in North America.

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased to announce the following appointments in that business unit:

Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
Philippe Bibi: Chief Technology Officer
Jeff, Louise, and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley, will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman’s departure from Enron North America’s natural gas operation, all of Jeff’s direct reports will report to John Lavorato. We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North America Office of the Chairman. John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer. Dave Delainey will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer. Mark Frevert will retain his role as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Paulo and I have continued to look at the model and have come up with a couple of additional changes:

The cash flow calculations need to include the overlying option strike payment. Also, Paulo is trying to clarify if the cash flows should be discounted to the valuation date or reported as notional future values.

I would suggest trying changing the option valuation from a binomial tree approach to a one-dimensional integration, perhaps using a quadrature method. This may allow us to minimize the size of the delta discontinuities.

"" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to 
be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular 
fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to 
a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is 
quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.

The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't 
work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation 
and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most 
often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux 
bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous 
is broken as well). ""

[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge 
our networks? ]]

"" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC 
headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the 
right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on 
how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in 
hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).

In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or 
wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about 
turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. ""

[[ Is this true? ]]


"" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other 
methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... ""


[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. 
But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?


Vince. ]]

PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606

July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET

       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.

       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""

       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.

       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""

       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""

Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic.

1021,1021,ham,"
I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.

I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.


My questions are:

1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?

2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the <Virtual . . .> section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.

3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?

Thanks in advance for your help.

The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing 

ONCE UPON A TIME a Wolf resolved to disguise his 
appearance in order to secure food 
more easily. Encased in the skin of a sheep, he 
pastured with the flock deceiving the shepherd 
by his costume. In the evening he was shut up by 
the shepherd in the fold; the gate was closed, 
and the entrance made thoroughly secure. But the 
shepherd, returning to the fold during the night 
to obtain meat for the next day, mistakenly 
caught up the Wolf instead of a sheep, and 
killed him instantly. 
Harm seek. harm find.

xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xaNUMBER xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xgNUMBER that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xaNUMBER accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xaNUMBER is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to NUMBER times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xgNUMBER execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly

>""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth connections can download portions, or 'stripes,' of a file from several cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header for the file.""

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that a spam hits 5.0. Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules. Spams will hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works. But for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores correctly, we just have to optimize to hit one threshold.

The problem is, anyone can design a good web form, but nobody does. I think ""best practices"" haven't caught up on main street web enablement yet. There's some really great packages on how to do this stuff, and in fact, the usability people knew that web forms needed to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms and XHTML.

You can shoot yourself in the foot, and people usually do. The problem is, they don't even recognize that they're gimpy—ever. They just keep trundling along, making a mess of everything assured in their job security that they can build web forms without even caring if they can be used or not beyond their test machine. If you had a piece of software and a security warning came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software? Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally broken 4 years and 11 months ago? What I want to know is why would someone use web forms best practices from 5 years ago? I mean, you can get a college degree in that time.

Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window manager? Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for a brief period, but they are completely useless except for some terminal-based replacement applications. The bottom line is, if you can't get across the bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault it really is, and it's the business that needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

Comes with some lovely client tools also. Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures, triggers.

It's really amazing to think how much they've got out of a db that is only 4 MB in size - that's 10 times smaller than the Oracle client.

Having said all of the above, Oracle is really a super product, but ya pays ya money... IBM's DB2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle. Free single developer license downloadable from their website.

Consider it on my list of things to check.

Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't support the icon window. However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality which may solve the issue. You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always show sequences"" to make this work. If so, let me know so I can put that in the help window for ""Icon Window"" as it already is for ""Hide When Empty"".

I'm looking to build a completely silent pc. It's gonna be a gateway for a wireless network and will sit in my room (as my room is only spitting distance from the chimney where I'll be mounting the aerial). It has to be completely silent, or it'll do my nut. What do I need?

I'll probably use a shitty P166 I have here; it doesn't have a fan, and I'm not worried about HD noise too much as it'll be idle mostly (should I be?). Any info would be appreciated. I can't afford one of those lovely new shoebox size totally silent PCs, and I can't use an old laptop as I have a PCI wireless card and cable already bought ($160 or so).

And where can I get a fanless PSU? I know they exist because the lads at Antefacto had them (lads, where can I get one?). Although I do remember a slight lack of metal box around the humongous voltage parts!

Wilsonian - We should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy, etc.
Jacksonian - We should never get involved in foreign adventures. Unless we're attacked. Then we go Rambo.
He has tactfully left out the hard realists*; as for the rest I gather wilsonians play the idealists, and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect, and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap.

Kissinger himself seems to be a Hamiltonian; much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions.

Maybe I've been too affected by Kant, but I can't see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a Bismarck running it: how lopsided does the US look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics?

I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the pickle to an anydbm file). Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's simple:

People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.
Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.
I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:

OVERALL SPAM NONSPAM S/O SCORE NAME
13851 8919 4932 0.64 0.00 (all messages)

So they have Aaron Schwartz on NPR's Weekend Edition talking about Warchalking. I'll agree, it's funny, his voice is squeaky and I'm jealous that he got on radio and I didn't... But really, WTF is the big deal about warchalking? I have yet to see any of it, anywhere. Link will probably pop up on www.npr.org later today.

Of course, that's still a lot of mass to hit the planet even if it is in the form of dust and gas. Antimissile defense is designed to operate in ~LEO environment, and knocks out stuff by kinetic kill or nearby nuking (damage by neutron flux impacting the fissibles). It is not designed to apply a 100 MT warhead (we don't have these, and synchronous impact is even more out of question) detonate-on-impact to a 28 km/s rock or rubble target. A 100 MT warhead most assuredly will scarcely fragment a 2 km target in the few seconds left before the impact. This is so obvious it doesn't even need to be modeled.

Even if Shrub's wrist-rocket managed to vaporise it, we'd still get transference to the Earth's energy balance, only to the atmosphere rather than the litho- or hydrosphere. The anti-missile defense is about worse than useless in this case. The only way to protect is determining orbits at high precision and deflecting long-term.

1115,1115,ham,"The Electronic Telegraph: Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
Filed: 28/08/2002

So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham, or sick of Sheffield?

Those 54 percent of Britons—according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey this week—who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.

Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial Russia.

After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side.

""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.

""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemly cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11 am, most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""

The time for elevenses in Britain—perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate Hobnob—is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour. It was so named in Soviet times because, at 11 am, a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the Obraztsov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops.

And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life.""

""The local shops are full of all they would need, and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks.""

There are 100 kopecks in a ruble, and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling.

The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton will have consumed before. It is made of samogon—home-distilled, moonshine vodka—coloured with tea and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics.

While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs—selecting oxtail soup as an example—were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British settler should overcome the difficulty.

""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""

One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the Mongolian border.

However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 percent of Britons who nominated France as the country in which they would like to live.

France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes, and Russian tourists.""

Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.

Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common. And somewhere like the Sakha Republic—east of Siberia and the coldest place in the world—enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.

Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself.""

Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in Britain if 54 percent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.

""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found among our citizens.""

Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their preferred new home.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.  
Best of luck

As the legislative season ends, it is vitally important to gather support for legislation that will be center-stage in the next session. This is an opportunity to ask your representative to take a stand for your rights. Ask her/him to co-sponsor the DMCRA today!

Representatives Rick Boucher and John Doolittle recently introduced the Digital Media Consumers' Rights Act (DMCRA, H.R. 5544), which would require labeling on usage-impaired ""copy-protected"" compact discs and would make several amendments to 1998's infamous Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

ALERT: Bait and Switch; Anticounterfeiting Bill Hurts Your Rights!

Don't be fooled by Senator Biden's ""Anticounterfeiting Amendments of 2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:

Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could prohibit the use of interface information essential for software interoperability and competition
Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to reconfigure their products.
Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by the Copyright Act for identical behavior
This ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to: action.eff.org

Canadian Trademark Law Overreaching

EFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem especially egregious.

Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group. Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed computer service and the other for information freely available on the public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet.""

Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner and Gervais, LLP.

Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw, and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net"" when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free legal information to the public.

For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help, please contact:

We're proud to introduce our new Apparel and Accessories store with over 400 major clothing brands (including Gap, Old Navy, Nordstrom, Lands' End, Target, Eddie Bauer, Foot Locker, and many more).

Our goal is to provide complete apparel selection and offer it the Amazon way—with easy navigation, a single shopping cart, your shipping and payment information already on file, etc. Of course, none of this would be possible without our many apparel store partners (we're thankful to have such an amazing group of companies working with us).

We released a beta version of the Apparel store about a week ago, and much to our surprise, tens of thousands of clothing and accessory items have already been ordered. Through the first few days of our beta, customers have ordered:

14,487 shirts (Polo Ralph Lauren button-downs to DKNY blouses)
1,843 jackets (Old Navy fleece to Polartec windbreakers)
2,712 sweaters (Eddie Bauer V-necks to Liz Claiborne cardigans)
140 swimsuits (Tommy Bahama to Speedo)
9,408 pants (Gap khakis to Guess jeans)
485 skirts (Nordstrom suede to Spiegel leather)
1,461 sleepwear items (Marshall Field's satin robes to Lands' End flannel pajamas)
3,254 pairs of shoes (Nike Air Max to Nine West boots)
1,870 pairs of socks (Cole Haan cashmere-blend to OshKosh B'Gosh cotton)
2,805 accessories (handbags, watches, scarves, etc.)
3,287 pairs of underwear (Jockey briefs to Hugo Boss boxers). We all need clean underwear, right?

Thousands spent on strippers, golf memberships shows Pentagon spending is out of control, Libertarians say

WASHINGTON, DC -- Quiz question: Which of the following items have been charged to the taxpayers recently by military personnel wielding government-issued credit cards?

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases.

(b) $3,400 for a Sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for Halloween costumes.

(c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf membership.

(d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river rock"" at a military base in the Arabian desert.

(e) all of the above.

""Incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,'"" said Steve Dasbach, Libertarian Party executive director. ""Thanks to the federal government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, the military has launched a raid on your wallet.""

The shocking revelations are contained in a General Accounting Office audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly unneeded expenditures"" made by the Air Force and Army in 2000 and 2001. The purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax credit card policy: At least 1.4 million Defense Department employees carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 billion in goods and services, the audit found.

In one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military IDs and government-issued travel cards to get cash at adult-entertainment bars, then spent the money there. The clubs charged a 10 percent fee to supply the soldiers with cash -- then billed the full amount to their travel cards as a restaurant charge, the GAO found.

""Are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a strip club, or defending our country while wearing a Sumo wrestling suit?"" asked Dasbach. ""Americans who support a bigger defense budget, take note: The Pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, reckless government agency. It promises your money will be spent on the worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even imagine.""

Other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and armchair at a military installation in the Middle East, Dasbach noted.

Some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" such as Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates.

Not surprisingly, Dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, so taxpayers may end up paying the tab.

""It's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat Defense Department workers, and force them to personally reimburse taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said.

""Then cut the Pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard against such wasteful spending in the future. Perhaps that's one way to force the Pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, instead of offending the taxpayer.""",normal,,"ham,normal,"

THE BUZZ ABOUT THE UPCOMING MOVIE

People are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in ""The Secret Life of Zoey."" Lifetimetv.com community member BELFAST BELLE writes:

""My belief is that I started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. My mom died when I was 10. I had to live away from my dad and brothers. Where I grew up I was sexually abused for years, but I didn't dare tell anyone. When I finally went to live with my dad and brothers, I had no self-esteem left. I experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. Drugs helped me to feel OK and like I was a part of something. When my dad died, I was devastated. It threw me into a full-blown addiction. My drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. Thanks to the help of Narcotics Anonymous, I have been clean since December 28, 1991. I now have great relationships with my siblings. I love them more than they will ever know. I also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. I don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best person I can be.""

steve's comment has many merits. I think stinson gibner and grant masson (physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.
on the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in their time estimates, the technology they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous potential payoffs. It makes sense to stay close to them and to explore potential investment opportunities.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for taking the time to dine with Chris and me back on Monday, October 2.

Further to our dinner, I would like to forward you information on three topics:

2. Our country managing partner for Russia.
3. Details of our 21st Energy Symposium are attached below.

The Energy Symposium is one of the largest energy conferences in the world, and we are successful in attracting senior energy executives as speakers to this two-day event. This year's event will be November 28 & 29.

The Energy Symposium is much more than just an ""accounting conference."" Industry leaders discuss a range of topics and share their perspectives on strategic, economic, political, financial, and operating issues. Participants find the networking aspect of the symposium to be especially valuable. There is ample time during the event for them to meet and talk with their counterparts and colleagues in the industry. And it is a premier marketing opportunity for Arthur Andersen, where more than 300 partners and managers get to spend two days with 700 executives from the energy and utilities industry in a forum.

The symposium check-in begins Monday, November 27 at 6 p.m., with a cocktail reception in the Galleria Ballroom foyer. Arthur Andersen personnel are encouraged to attend for an opportunity to network with colleagues, clients, and prospective clients in an informal setting.

Thank you in advance, and I look forward to seeing you and your clients in Houston.

Victor A. Burk

Hi Maureen,

It was good to meet you last week and hear your presentation on the metals—full of advice on what to think about and all the various things that affect the marketplace. I am only sorry I had to dash off to the airport; good job I left when I did, though, as check-in took ages!

Anyway, please could you send me through a copy of that presentation either on email, or if it is located on the network somewhere, then I could access it over the intranet? I will be joining the LME conference tomorrow, so I am currently trying to do a bit of reading in preparation.

Good morning Mr. Martin,

I would like to introduce myself. I currently work with Christie Patrick and Michael B. Rosen in the Enron University Affairs department.

In recent discussions with Christie, she has suggested that I liaise with you and our management in preparation for your and Vince Kaminski's case study. Christie has forwarded recent emails sent by you suggesting a few convenient times that work with your schedule. I will work with our management and do my best to schedule one-hour time slots for interviews that fit with your outline.

Initially, I will schedule interviews with:
- Ken Lay - Chairman and CEO
- Jeff Skilling - President and COO
- Andy Fastow - CFO

If you feel that you may need to speak with additional management, we will definitely try to work something out the same day, so you don’t have to travel back here. I will forward your project outline to the aforementioned participants once the interviews are scheduled. Do you anticipate drafting specific questions? If so, I would greatly appreciate a copy when convenient.

I greatly look forward to working with you, and I hope that we can touch base very soon.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I would like to thank you for the interview opportunity at Enron. It was very nice and pleasant to talk with such talented people.

I hope this interview develops to the next stage of the opportunity. As a matter of fact, I have started a current job at Kansas City with an internship expiring on November 3rd. I received a permanent job offer from them, and I think I need to decide whether to accept the offer or not very soon. However, after my visit to Enron, I feel that I want to pursue my career development at Enron for many reasons.

If the decision process is made soon, I would greatly appreciate it. (I apologize for the hurry; I just sent a message regarding my situation to Molly a minute ago.)

Thank you very much.

1191,1191,ham,"Hi Mel,

Further to our earlier discussions, here’s the full list of actions we’d like to put into place regarding Anjam’s departure:

HR-type stuff:

Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible. There is no need for him to remain on the floor. This will need to be delayed until #1 is completed (cataloguing his work).
Determine where Anjam is heading. We need to know who is going to know our positions and curves next.
Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in the building. Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.
IT-type stuff:

Ask him to catalogue the contents of his H: drive, since the rest of the group will need to support his work in the future. This should take no more than a day or two.
Get IT to obtain backups of Anjam’s H: drive for weekly intervals over the last two months. This will allow us to determine what he has deleted.
Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam’s notes folders and provide records of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months. I’m worried about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from Anjam’s C: drive. There may be useful info here too.
Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail.
Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.

Note from Mark Frevert:

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created this email newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various businesses. I hope you find it informative and, more importantly, that you will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in your group.

To provide content for future emails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our public relations group via email or call her at ext. 3-9767. Communication is one of the core Enron values, and I believe this is a great way to improve communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minutes to complete & the pulse & 8 survey. This annual survey regarding the work experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of the two-way communication process at Enron. Please go to the Enron intranet and type survey.enron.com. It only takes a few minutes, it's confidential, and your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.

**Business Highlights:**

**Natural Gas**  
Middle Marketing’s biggest trade of the year so far occurred this month. The significant transaction was a five-year, multimillion-dollar restructuring with a subsidiary of Formosa Plastics, one of the world’s largest producers of polyvinyl chloride. Additionally, Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, has hedged a considerable amount (1.2 million barrels/month) of crude oil. Winter NYMEX hedges were put in place for the undisputed heavyweight chip champ of the world, Frito Lay.

**Pulp & Paper**  
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of ClickPaper.com, Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper commodities. Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price transparency and reliability and access to Enron’s online financial markets. Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron’s trading business. To date, ClickPaper.com has traded over 1 million tons of pulp and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

**Upstream Origination**  
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natural gas products to optimize commercial value associated with the natural gas grid on the continent and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Through products such as storage, electric compression, and producer services & outsourcing, ENA creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas infrastructure to be more efficient. In addition, upstream origination transactions exploit the unique relationship between the development of strategic assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of the market information created by those assets.

**& The Pulse & 8 Survey Results**  
As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to & The Pulse & 8 from ENA/EGM/EIM are 689. This is approximately 30% of all employees. Since our goal is a 100% response rate, we have a long way to go! Please take a few minutes to log on and give Enron your thoughts. The pulse is located at survey.enron.com on the Enron intranet page.

The program for the GARP 2001 Convention is nearly printed, and I will be sending you a few copies of the program in the next few days. In the meantime, you can find the program on our website at www.garp.com.

In addition, I am writing to inquire whether your organization can establish a web link to our program through your organization's website. Below is the information that is of most importance and that I would like included:

**GARP 2001 - 2nd Annual Risk Management Convention & Exhibition**  
February 12th to 15th, 2001, New York.  
For full program details, please visit www.garp.com or contact GARP on tel. +44 (0)20 7626 9300.

Of course, you could highlight your participation at this event, which will include a two-day convention with pre- and post-convention workshops and an asset management forum that will include over 80 senior financial and risk management professionals. I have also attached a small logo that could be used as a link to the GARP website. Can I please have the web address should you or your colleagues manage to establish a web link to the convention? If you also feel that there are any important websites that this convention should be posted on, then I would appreciate it if you could pass on this information.

Just to keep you informed, already, within a week of the website going 'live', there have been about a dozen bookings and numerous inquiries. This is a very good sign that GARP 2001 will be a great success and will outdo GARP 2000.

Of course, if you have any questions or queries, please do not hesitate to contact me. I thank you in advance for your cooperation, and I look forward to meeting you in New York in February.

Kind regards,

This morning, a draft of RAC's inflation model review was discussed with Anjam. All points as presented in the draft were agreed upon. 

Additionally, four new points were amended as suggested by Anjam:

1. The RPI short-term model could be improved by a combination of the information available from the gilts and RPI swaps market.
2. Add: ""This is an issue across all Enron's econometric models."" to section PLU and DZCV short-term, first point.
3. To implement some of the suggestions requires additional statistical and programming resources.
4. Additional human resources with advanced econometric modeling skills are required given the current workload of the European research team.

Please find the final version attached. 

Please note that the short-term solution has been to freeze the curve. The medium to long-term solution involves further research towards a sounder and more efficient model. Given the current workload of the European research group, it is necessary to hire a new member of staff with a strong economics and econometrics background to address this issue properly.

RAC will communicate to the financial trading group and risk management the actions to take as the curve will be frozen.

I am sure that all of you have seen the notice sent this morning from Charlene Jackson, Managing Director of the Associate and Analyst Program. I wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team MDS and IT team members to clarify any confusion surrounding Super Saturdays and technologist recruiting for the Global Technology Track. Although the Global Technology Track is part of the Analyst and Associate Program, we will not be participating in the Super Saturday events listed below. Technologist candidates will be brought into the office for a Friday office visit.

Super Saturdays were first initiated for commercial analyst and associate recruiting because many Enron representatives were not able to leave their desks while the market was open during the workday. Bringing candidates in during the weekend works well in this situation because Enron representatives can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the office.

However, many technology VPs have suggested that seeing Enron ""alive and in action"" during the week would be a high selling point for technologist candidates. Therefore, we have opted to have technology office visits on Fridays. The first three office visits are listed below:

November 10th
December 1st
January 19th

The total annual revenue generated by these assets is no less than $20 billion and could be substantially higher as the estimated capacity on some of these facilities is likely understated, and other facilities not yet identified are likely to be vulnerable.

Note that this data does not include any facilities in the industrial complexes from Houston northward and eastward, as they are much less likely to experience such a drought-induced interruption. The only facilities identified thus far lie on or near the following rivers: Brazos, Colorado, Navidad, Guadalupe, and Nueces.

I interviewed Charles today at 10:30 AM. Here are my impressions:

Excellent professional and managerial experience.
Very good technical background in deal valuation and model implementation.
Promises to fit very well into the group’s culture.
The only issue I see is that he would have to leave a high-level position at his current employer.

Very communicative.
Good professional experience - works as a consultant.
Good quantitative background.
He lacks a background in finance, which may be a minus for a position in the group. I believe he may be valuable for other areas that deal with emissions and pollutants.

Here are a few comments on this note:

The deal with the seismic company was done by Mark Peterson, who is still with Enron. I haven’t caught up with him for details, but it had to do with underwriting (risk of no sales) seismic survey. Timing is important. Interest may have picked up in new surveys, and the survey company decided that they didn’t need Enron anymore because they no longer saw a risk of no sales.

3-D surveys will happen where there is an abundance of E&P activity or be spurred on by successes in a given basin. While activity continues in the Gulf of Mexico on the shelf, the major discoveries are being found in the deep water. Worldwide, the shallow water plays have been looked at and worked for years—they were accessible with the extraction technology of the time. I don’t think that deep water sedimentation/depositional systems were completely understood to even begin to try to justify looking in deep water. Concepts have evolved quite quickly. The point is that many deep water accumulations are incredibly large—billion-barrel accumulations. These sizes are like those accumulations that were found decades ago when companies were drilling surface structures. The large reserves are needed to pay for the corresponding incredibly expensive costs of deepwater field development. I believe that finding and development costs ($/barrel) are at least two to three times shelf F&D costs in the Gulf of Mexico. This differential is probably large with international projects (and that doesn’t take into account political risk).

I’ll look forward to more involvement if and when this project/concept goes forward. Feel free to forward this to all participants.

I am preparing a summary of our Thursday discussions to be used as a background piece for discussion/brainstorming with oil traders. I will circulate this for review/correction later today, or at the latest, Monday. Greg, you mentioned that Enron had participated in a speculative survey in the Gulf of Mexico that was successful. It might be useful to get more info on this: terms, return realized (over what time frame), why we have not continued to do this, etc. Also, from your comments, many, if not most, of the 3-D surveys are in deep water. I read recently that Shell, I believe, is participating in a deep-sea drilling/extraction project in the Gulf. What oil price is required to make these kinds of projects viable financially?

I hope that the following clears up some of the confusion regarding the above-captioned process.

Factor loadings are an input to value-at-risk (VaR). Generally, you can consider them the determinants of relationships between curves and points on curves based on trader inputs. These pertain to all curves, not just North American natural gas. There is a specific program that calculates these relationships, which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3 hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results. 

There is no ""ideal"" or recommended period in which these must be updated. More frequent is ""better."" Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it was ""agreed"" a long time ago amongst RAC, research, IT, and operations that it would be done every 2 weeks. No commercial input was received. The roles were to be simple, as they are with most roles in and around VaR and other risk management controls:
- Research specifies the math
- IT codes the program
- Operations runs the program
- RAC evaluates the results

The process has been run every two weeks on the second Thursday of every month since February (as it had been prior), and RAC has rejected the results because they did not reflect the underlying math due to the complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and curves. This created the need to recode the application from scratch. RAC continued to agitate to get this done, particularly knowing that the efficacy of VaR would be questioned as we went into the volatile period of 2000 (e-mails from Rudi Zipter available upon request). The new code was implemented last Thursday, and the results were accepted, resulting in an approximate 10% difference in VaR.

RAC had requested that the code be rewritten on 6/10/99 @ 7:44 AM with a target completion date of 8/2/99. This was discussed and accepted by Phillipe Bibi on 6/17/99 in a meeting in his conference room with Rick Buy, Dan Bruce, Jonathon Le, Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, Debbie Brackett, and Rudi Zipter along with the rest of our task list.

We have resolved that the process will continue as stated and will communicate the results to you. There are dozens of other processes that are important to the calculation and interpretation of VaR that need to be implemented, enhanced, improved, or rewritten altogether. For example, the jump-diffusion factors for North American power have not been refreshed in 2000. The priority is dependent on the level of precision required.

I will provide a comprehensive list of those processes in due course.

Thanks for your help in this matter. I don't want to be a bother to you. I know you are doing your best to put this together as a go-between.

As you might suspect, I am in a hurry to put together the right hearing at Enron because MarketPoint is just now being completed—U.S. and world oil and gas and North American electricity. We have just signed up our first web provider (e-acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North American electric generation database over their website. I believe we are an integral part of their offering. It won’t be long before MarketPoint needs the capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally and quickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vend or offer fundamental forward projections from our models. I am loath to do so without the capitalization and staffing we need. Also, I am loath to do so without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantly available.

I would also be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue the discussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly. I plan to be there the last week in June.

Thanks again for all your help and support.

**Companies & Finance: The Americas: Enron Sees Bricks and Bytes Mix Reshaping Energy Market:**  
Purchase of MG Only a Start in Building B 2 B Platforms, Writes Hillary Durgin

**Companies Financial Times; 16-Jun-2000 12:00:00 AM; 604 words by Hillary Durgin**

If Jeffrey Skilling is right, Enron's acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg. Enron's president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant ""new economy"" player across various industrial markets.

The dollars 446 million acquisition last month of MG, the UK-based metals trader, is only the first of more than dollars 1 billion in estimated new investments the company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to build business-to-business (B 2 B) platforms in sectors such as logistics, chemicals, agricultural products, and pulp & paper.

Mr. Skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets. He argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal B 2 B sites for those sectors but reshape those industries.

As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce platform, EnronOnline, which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales. The company—the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power—saw wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 percent in the first quarter.

Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar energy business into new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts point out Enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of gas and power in the US, and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.

""It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an orderly way,"" says Ronald Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. ""What they're doing here is what they've been incredibly successful at doing,"" he adds, noting that Enron posted dollars 1.3 billion in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 percent from the previous year.

Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of the company's overall income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr. Barone sees the unit's EBIT increasing 15-30 percent annually over several years.

As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is standardizing contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant, risk management, and financial services over the internet.

""We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide liquidity, and we will provide settlement, or fulfillment of that contract,"" Mr. Skilling says. ""That is an extremely powerful model. If you look at other B 2 B sites, they don't do that.""

Mr. Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will triumph over the other bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, price, credit, and fulfillment.

Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for example, would rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco recently purchased a 3 percent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston-based, neutral wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and American Electric Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity.

Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, Enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring MG, Enron got a stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical position.

""It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active physical spot market in more markets in the world,"" says Greg Whalley, chief executive officer of Enron Networks, the new division Enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other markets, Enron will deliver better pricing, price risk management services, cross-commodity transactions, and flexib",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Interviewer: If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who would they be and how would they get on?

Response: Mark, the zine would be Jethro Bodine from The Beverly Hillbillies—curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory or conspiracy as absolute truth. The blog would be Sherman from Peabody's Improbable History, a traveler of time and space in search of beauty, truth, and the outre.

I think Jethro Boing Boing and Sherman Boing Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman’s dog, Mr. Peabody, to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 50 years into the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

A large number of Internap's connections to UUNet remain shutdown, and traffic is being routed over alternate providers. The scale of this outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUNet and other providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.

Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.

More details about these are at [http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/](http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/)

None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.

POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most proprietary Unixes implement. The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.

It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base. People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.

Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors.

In detail, he wrote:
> Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for nontrivial apps? No way!

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing for many years. Very few applications need the aio_* calls --- essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes. This just provides a modicum of extra performance.

> OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely ghetto, but at least they are trying. Keep trying guys, you got the idea, but not the clue.

Readers can judge who lacks the clue here.

> The Windows I/O model does definately [sic] blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to point at in it's [sic] suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX is just now looking at it's [sic] I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out of it.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is 13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice. They might be even older than that.

Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

> Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working so great anymore.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process. By contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process polls them.

I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case (although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards. Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth, Fla., was handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section, Steven Feuer, began behaving erratically. Two U.S. air marshals confronted Mr. Feuer, handcuffed him, and seated him next to Dr. Rajcoomar in first class.

Dr. Rajcoomar asked to change seats and the incident could have ended there, but one marshal brandished a gun, issuing commands that terrified the passengers. There was no threat, and yet, when the plane landed, Dr. Rajcoomar was inexplicably handcuffed and detained for three hours.

Dr. Rajcoomar believes he was targeted because of his Indian descent. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) provided no reasonable explanation, other than accusing him of ""watching the incident too closely."" Lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case.

Dr. Rajcoomar expressed his dismay over how security measures are infringing on freedoms, stating, ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security.""",normal,,"ham,normal,"

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument 
against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.

Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put 
/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.

If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.

> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! 

It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)

Good luck,
Thomas

The powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The Omagh-based paper's ""As the Man Says"" column brings a story which originated in the Middle East.

""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.
""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""
It is then explained: ""He had paid £625 to a local sorcerer and believed that he was invisible.""

In the Lurgan Mail, there was also news of a dramatic robbery.
""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through three walls to steal £10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.
""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the contents.""

The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the Down Democrat. John Coulter calls on the authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.
He writes: ""The time has come to fight fire with fire before unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of sentences.""

As an alternative to such violence, he recommends controlled violence. He writes: ""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""

Getting his defence in early, he rounds on potential critics: ""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is the order of the day... Islam is the fastest-growing faith on the British mainland.""

How Microsoft plans to take over your living room
By David Coursey

Microsoft's upcoming **Windows XP Media Center Edition** does more than just add a personal video recorder (PVR) and a new interface to the operating system. It could be the opening move in the company's strategy to dominate home entertainment. This new edition of Windows is set to integrate TV recording, media playback, and PC functions, positioning Microsoft as a major player in the digital living room.

David Coursey explains how the combination of a personal video recorder, an easy-to-use interface, and the connectivity of a Windows system is an essential step for Microsoft in controlling the way we consume media. This vision of home entertainment includes not just TV, but music, photos, and even the internet, all seamlessly brought together in one device.

In addition to discussing Microsoft's media ambitions, the newsletter includes various other tech news items:  
- **Gates' Tech Views:** Bill Gates shares his thoughts on key tech issues in his newsletter.  
- **Cheap PCs from Gateway:** Gateway targets back-to-school buyers with affordable PCs.  
- **Sony's New Mini Digital Camera:** Is this new tiny digicam the next must-have gadget?  
- **Speeding up Dial-up Web Surfing:** Tips for faster internet connections, including David Coursey's Propel service recommendation.

drive, connect it to the working server, do a dd of the entire disk to the

Something like

dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

unpartitioned disk. So if hte machine breaks, I can get the new disk and put

1289,1289,ham,"Hi all,

With respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more often than I want to (see below), I had a guess that it is related to the device frame rate. In that context, I tried to set the frame rate of my inbuilt iSight to 1, and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this:

err = SGSetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo, IntToFixed(1));
Fixed *frameRate;
SGGetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo, frameRate);
int rate = FixedToInt(*frameRate);
cout << ""FrameRate: "" << rate << endl;  // PLOTS 1 WHEN EXECUTING
However, when I execute the app, the frame size is much higher (I guess 30 fps or more). I saw an older post from 2007 that dealt with the same problem of not being able to set the inbuilt iChat frame rate, but nobody replied. Does anyone have a guess how to approach this problem?

I have a thread that triggers the SGIdle call according to my desired frame rate:

void video::run(){
 while (running){

   sj->dFC->videoWaiter->wait(sj->dFC->videoBlocker);

   err = SGIdle(videoData->seqGrab);
   usleep(1000000 / 1);   // FRAMERATE

   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->unlock();
 }
}
In this example, the thread waits for 1 second before executing the next time, which results in a frame rate of 1 fps. However, I discovered some strange system behavior, which forced me to verify if this is really the case: I applied a time measurement between each data processing function call, and in fact, it is executed 4 more times in approximately 250 microsecond intervals. In the following, I have plotted the measured interval times in ms:

I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.

1298,1298,ham,"Rohit was wondering what Microsoft's definition of a Chief Software
Architect is (and, consequently, what Microsoft thinks is a roadmap).
Here you go, from Mr. Ballmer to Mr. Gillmor to Mr. FoRK...
Architecture is war; love 'em or hate 'em, at least Microsoft
understands that: as Chief SA, BillG oversees all product strategy.""There are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.""""Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.""""People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.""http://www.infoworld.com/articles/pl/xml/02/07/22/020722plballmer.xmlBallmer in charge 
July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PTNO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.> How so?Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that reall",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Battered stocks regain ground
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

With rebates, HP angles for PC sales 
Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or advertisemental programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay 
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss 
Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73%

Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02 
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99%

**Rhapsody rules**  
I never thought I’d say it, but I’m changing my tune about subscription music services. When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. But after trying Listen.com’s **Rhapsody**, a subscription streaming music service, my opinion shifted. Rhapsody has music from all five major labels, offering thousands of albums and preprogrammed radio stations. However, Rhapsody isn’t for everyone—CD burning is limited, and you can’t download MP3s. Would you pay $10 a month for streaming music without MP3 downloads? Let me know at edit@download.com.

Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002
The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data....http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,103259,00.asp

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htmInternet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry PurpuroNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money  in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication  mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
 unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them  to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60  percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail  accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better  ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient  groups.But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter  an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without  opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage  the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam  advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

1316,1316,ham,"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux. 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,

get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)_________________________________________________________________

The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you
have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.

I run 10.5 on such a powerbook as well as a 1GHz G4 eMac. If anything

3/4 GB. The only downside was that at some point there was an update to 
10.5 where my firewire enclosure became unreliable. It seems to affect 
certain ide to fw bridge chips in hard drive enclosures and I was unlucky. 
I can usually power cycle the drive and try again successfully. It matters 
not which cable and drive I use, I have three enclosures, and once is the 
culprit.

With regards to X11, the growing pains are mostly over for me. I do use

though. The key options to Xvnc are -cc 3 -depth 8

Your best option is, as others have said, to use pinning.  If that
doesn't work, or you prefer not to use that method, you could

1) simply uninstall durep using the package manager you usually use,
then d/l the package from the repos, and install, by hand, from your
local copy.

or

2) build and install from source as the package manager will know
nothing about it that way.

> `Bonding' seems to achieve what I wanted to do. Thanks.

Sure? I don't think so :-)

""Bonding"" is for ethernet devices, nothing to do with using your 
""router's bandwith"". Ethernet bonding is like hard disk raid: it will 
prevent for a ""link"" going down and you can use it to increasing 
throughput but what you want to achieve is not done with that, as you 
will be still facing the problem on how/where to route packages.

Also, bonding requires at least 2 ethernet adapters. 

A very good bonding tutorial:

http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/bonding

But you may need something like this:

DQ> Before we release, it'd be great if someone could test a few
DQ> additional score ranges.  Maybe we can lower FPs a bit more.  :-)

I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can 
achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.

The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.

The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

DQ> Something like:
DQ> 
DQ>   for (low = -12; low <= -4; low += 2)
DQ>     for (high = 2; high <= 6; high += 2)
DQ>       evolve

You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.

DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.

Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

At the OS X conference, Cory told me about a book called ""The Life and Death of 
the Great American Cities,"" by Jane Jacobs. This Metropolis Magazine comic 
strip, by Ben Katchor, seems to resonate with what Cory told me about the book 
-- that cities die because mixed used areas are changed into single use areas.

Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] 

Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. 

Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. 

Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. 

""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 

I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 

On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 

I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 

In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 

In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 

I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 

I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 

I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 

Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
tilde. 

Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 
directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 

But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 

As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
tilde. 

In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
tilde in its URL. 

Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 

Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses. 

Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 

And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 
Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ASCII characters. 

As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11]. 

In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 

In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 

As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 

As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 

In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
(history,tilde,job control)[16]. 

As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
in the APL-11 character set[18]. 

In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh). 

In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 
this typographical pun[21]. 

And that's the earliest reference I can find. 

So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) 

If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. 

So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. 

There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. 
Oops.

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. &#8220;Microsoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; 

The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. 

Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 

Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif

page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).

Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. 

The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"".

=== Scissors === 

I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 

    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 

She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 

I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 

*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  

=== Waiting for Wireless === 

Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 

=== Irony === 

According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 

I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 

Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 

=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 

Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 

This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 

=== Arrival === 

I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. 

Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 

    Squid on the Mantelpiece 

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.

I've been in Austin all weekend. On Friday, I spoke at the University of Texas 
about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
blogged the hell out of the talk: 

    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
    ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
    This principle is under attack. 

    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
    for creating a piece of code.

Seriously. Look at the life expectancy and human carrying capacity of this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendants of slaves, who were brought here by force.

More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.

Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in wealth has nothing to do with it.

It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is statistical sophistry.

Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes 400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point, they're nowhere near the top.

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list: ""and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt, or Morgan rates a mention on the current Forbes Four Hundred.""

This paper presents a new generation of attacks against Microsoft Windows, and possibly other message-based windowing systems. The flaws presented in this paper are, at the time of writing, unfixable. The only reliable solution to these attacks requires functionality that is not present in Windows, as well as efforts on the part of every single Windows software vendor. Microsoft has known about these flaws for some time; when I alerted them to this attack, their response was that they do not class it as a flaw - the email can be found here.

This research was sparked by comments made by Microsoft VP Jim Allchin who stated, under oath, that there were flaws in Windows so great that they would threaten national security if the Windows source code were to be disclosed. He mentioned Message Queueing, and immediately regretted it. However, given the quantity of research currently taking place around the world after Mr. Allchin's comments, it is about time the white hat community saw what is actually possible.

In a spam filter, I'm much more concerned about false positives than false negatives. Spam types are so varied that I use all trustworthy methods available to detect it. I prefer a filter with three levels:

Red: Most certainly spam, verified by several sources, and no one claims, ""I know this is NOT spam."" I'd likely discard or archive it. I expect no false positives here.
Yellow: May be spam. A human should decide and report it.
Green: Probably not spam.
Spamassassin does something useful here, but it only has a binary is/isn't switch. That said, Razor is one part of my spam-fighting toolkit, and even if it fails to detect some known spam, other tools will likely catch it.

It uses a Shannon like entropy model for the anonymity provided by a system. It uses this model to analyse the effect of different parameters one can tune with mixmaster (POOLSIZE, RATE, in mixmaster.conf).

The ""anonymity entropy"" measurement can be interpreted as how many bits of information the attacker needs to identify a user and is computed from probabilities.

Would be interesting to try estimate the entropy provided by the current mixmaster network. A number of nodes publish their parameter choices, and traffic volume over time (in hourly increments).

All,

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

This time the problem seems to be that I overestimated xine-lib's configure
script as it seems that it doesn't support disabling arts... so if you have
arts-devel installed, its support will be compiled in :-/

Also, I had made another mistake and added the configure option to disable
lirc ot xine-lib when it should have been for xine-ui.

All this is fixed in the upcoming ""fr6"" release.

came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up

Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" 

    ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
    

    For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

Hi,

This might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)

I'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,
called UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).

I'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the
KOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in
which I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to
Ireland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.

So, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any
other free software.

Thank you very much for your help

Version              : 0.4.1-1.1~volatile1 (Lenny)
Importance           : medium

python-clamav, which provides Python bindings to ClamAV, a virus scanning
engine, needed a recompilation with the newer clamav 0.95.3.  If you use
python-clamav directly or through nautilus-clamscan, we strongly recommend
you to upgrade to this version, as the old version the package was linked
against stopped working.


Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

You can get the updated packages at

http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile/pool/volatile/main/p/python-clamav

and install them with dpkg, or add the volatile archive for Lenny
to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

 deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
 deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main

You can also use any of our mirrors.  See
http://www.debian.org/volatile/volatile-mirrors for the full list of
mirrors.  The archive signing keys were included in Debian Lenny.

Both computers have the same packages installed, thus it must be a

playing the audio through USB speakers (built into my monitor).

Interestingly, mplayer gives ok audio on both computers, and codeine

audio on both computers.

All other audio applications work fine on both computers (youtube,

> You really gotta know your hardware!

I don't find that to be true at all. For non-removable media, except for `/`, you can simply use UUIDs, and everything should be fine. For `/`, you can generally use a UUID too. Removable media can be handled in various ways. I prefer using udev to fill in any gaps; writing udev rules doesn't really require familiarity with hardware (udev will tell you everything useful), and there are some decent guides available.

I am a (tv)twm user. when I snarf text into my mouse cut buffer, and then
attempt to inject it into the exmh input windows for comp/repl, the 'point'
is often an apparently random place in the text pane, not where I think I
have current flashing cursor. I usually wipe out any of To:/Subject:/ with the text. Its
often not even beginning of line denoted, ie its an unexplicable number
of char spaces in to the text where it inserts, What am I doing wrong in either X, WM, shell, EXMH which is causing this?cheers

[IMG: http://www.konaweb.com/stick/left.jpg] I often carry my ukulele with me 
on planes. The case is so little it can fit in my suit case. I missed a great 
photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still 
need to carry around an amp, though. Link[1] Discuss[2] _(Thanks, Prentiss[3]!)

Nomad International Inc. (NDIN)  
A multi-national internet communications company developing cost-effective telecommunications through voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technologies.  
Shares outstanding: 34,000,000  
Float: 4,000,000  
Current price: $0.09  
Will it continue higher? Watch this one Friday as we know many of you like momentum.

Breaking news!!  
May 18 - Nomad International Inc. (NDIN) commented today on the recent announcement by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) that they would regulate voice over internet protocol (VoIP) service only when it is provided and used as local telephone service.  
In its decision, the CRTC determined that in an effort to build sustainable competition in local telephone markets, the incumbent carriers will not be permitted to price their local VoIP services below cost to stifle competition.  
The ruling is a very positive one for Nomad in our efforts to enter the Canadian market with our products via internet service providers, cable companies, and virtual operators. The ruling permits us to enter the market with a competitive framework, stated Jan Oliver, CEO of Nomad International Inc.

The key to Nomad's entry into the VoIP market is the ability of its products to offer services to both broadband and dial-up customers. Though broadband is gaining more acceptance and utilization worldwide, dial-up remains the primary source of internet connectivity. In the U.S. alone, there are over 200,000,000 users of the internet. Of the total users in the U.S., the total number of users of broadband is only approximately 40,000,000 (stats by the Yankee Group). Dial-up therefore represents approximately 80% of the entire internet connectivity market. The percentage of dial-up versus broadband users worldwide is even higher.

Nomad's ability to offer VoIP products to dial-up customers and service providers not only offers significant potential for market penetration but also sets the company apart from its competition in the marketplace by offering a unique, proprietary, and easily adaptable product.

**About Nomad International Inc.**  
Nomad International Inc. is a multi-national internet communications company developing cost-effective telecommunications through VoIP technologies. The company's revolutionary VoIP product line called Nomad Systems has dial-up, broadband, DSL, cable, satellite, and wireless capabilities. The company plans on targeting:  
1) National fixed-line tier carriers interested in effectively competing with the dominant carrier in their marketplace,  
2) Large multinational corporations needing a U.S. or European presence by having, for example, a United States number ringing in their offices in Guatemala or London—offering business partners a more economical way to communicate, and  
3) Immigrants in North America, a means of significantly lowering their communication expense with their relatives in their country of origin.

**Conclusion:**  
The examples above show the awesome earning potential of little-known companies that explode onto investors' radar screens; many of you are already familiar with this. Is NDIN poised and positioned to do that for you? Then you may feel the time has come to act... and please watch this one trade Friday! Go NDIN.

1541,1541,spam,"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting

1579,1579,spam,"Fw: The Gold BuddhaIn 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.

Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.

Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.
Get a financial checkup and a free video on how to become ""Financially Fit
For Life"" and discover the gold within your current income.

My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest—specifically houses that may not sell due to their condition or location.

I work with private investors using unconventional funding, allowing for cash purchases and quick closings (often within a week). I am pre-qualified for up to $900,000 and can pay full commission to agents.

I’m not a licensed real estate agent, so I can work flexibly with you. I may be interested in properties at or above market value, depending on the situation.

If you're interested in selling project homes or forming an alliance with Synteligent Properties, contact me at 847.366.4300 or jeremy@synteligent.com.

1641,1641,spam,"Strictly Private.Gooday,

With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. 

It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. 

My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.

When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. 

I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. 

To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. 

For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.

Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. 

I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.

Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

Dear [Recipient],

Are you finding it challenging to attract visitors to your website? Submitting your site to search engines can dramatically increase your online sales.

If you’ve invested time and money into your website, it’s crucial to ensure it’s visible. Without proper submission to search engines, your site may remain virtually invisible, making your efforts go unnoticed. To boost your revenue and ensure people can find your site, the best strategy is to make it visible in search engines where people are actively seeking information.

Take action now—submit your website to multiple search engines and watch as visitors begin to stream to your business.

1711,1711,spam,"CONSANTLY being bombarded by so-called “FREE” money-making systems that teases you with limited information, and when it’s all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business slowed-down (I have been self-employed all my life), so I looked for something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (great! because I had none) interested me to click on the link provided. And I don’t regret at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join only if (when) you make money. You also get to track the results of your time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.
This system is quite simply the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that I’ve seen before. Why? Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously consider if this is right for you. No teasing. No grand testimonies! No kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you “no idea” of their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you with the two things you really must know: “What’s it all about?” and “How does it work?”. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you don’t want to do that; by then you are “hooked” and now locked into a frustrating battle to try to get your money back!
I call this my “Platinum Choice” because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally different from previously misleading, “hook-first” programs that promise lofty mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own pockets! You’ve seen the headlines: “Join free and Make $10,000 every week for life” yeah, right!
I did not make millions yet, but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldn’t be able to do anything without corporate help – which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating.
You have to see this in action for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and the Internet’s explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free corporate help, on-time member’s support and even protective safeguards!
Get it now, and you can call me at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free. Good luck!

a request was brought up this week that I would like you to run by the managers for input:

add the deal price to the sales and supply list windows of path manager
this seems more significant based on the transactions from eol.
this has been mentioned in the past, but has had some related ""baggage"":
impact on performance, may run slower. could make it an option so you pay the price when you need it.
ability to show tier info. maybe just use the word ""tiered"" and not try to represent the actual pricing.
agreed format for those deals that have index pricing and percentage and fixed price offset (i.e., 98% of if. transco. znl + .02)

1749,1749,spam,"How are you doing today? Hope all is well with you and your family? You may
not understand why this mail came to you but kindly read the following procedures
for your claim. The United Nation Compensation Commission (UNCC) was created in
1991 as a subsidiary organ of the UN Security Council. Its mandate is to process
claims and pay compensation for losses and damages suffered as a direct result of
Internet Fraud.

The UNCC in conjunction with the Obama Campaign on the 12th of October
2008 organized a confederation meeting which ended 2 weeks later, with the
Secretary General to the UNITED NATIONS. This meeting was first held on the 8th of
April 2003 by the then secretary to the UN. You can view this page for your perusal
(http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/ik344.doc.htm).

This email is directed to all individuals that have been scammed in all parts of
the world. In reference to the just concluded meeting, the UNCC in affiliation
with Barrack Obama Campaign have agreed to compensate them with categorical
payment sum of $500,000 each. In its decision 17 of 24th March 2006, the
Governing Council established basic principles for the distribution of
compensation payments to successful claimants. This decision was made two months
before the resolution of the first installment of claims before the Commission.
As stated in the Secretary-General’s report of 2nd May 2006, it was anticipated
that the value of approved awards would far exceed the resources available in the
Compensation Fund at any given time. The Governing Council therefore devised a
mechanism for the allocation of available funds to successful claimants that gave
priority to the three urgent categories of claims and which, within each
category, would give equal treatment to similarly situated claims. Only when each
successful claimant in categories ""A"", ""B"" and ""C"" had been paid an initial
amount up to US$2,500 would payments commence for claims in other categories.

Accordingly, the first phase of payment involved an initial payment of US$2,500
to each successful individual claimant in categories ""A"" and ""C"". However, for
humanitarian reasons, all category ""B"" claims will be paid in full of a total
USD$500,000. A total of US$3,252,337,997.09 was made available to 1,498,119
successful individual claimants in categories ""A"", ""B"" and ""C"" under the first
phase of payments. Claimants includes every foreign contractor that may have not
received their contract sum, and people that have had an unfinished transaction or
international businesses that failed due to Government problems etc. We found
your name in our list and that is why you are receiving this email notification.

You are advised hereby to contact Mr. Jim Ovia of Zenith Bank Plc, as he is our
representative in Nigeria who will be releasing your refund payment to you.
Contact him immediately for your approved funds (USD$500,000). These funds are in a
Bank Draft for security purposes, so he will send it to you and you can cash it in
any bank of your choice. Therefore, you should send him your full Name, telephone
number and your correct mailing address where you want him to send the Draft to
you.

Contact Mr. Jim Ovia immediately for your Bank Draft:

Person to Contact: Mr. Manuel Gamallo
Email: gamallomanuel@hotmail.com

Thanks and God bless you and your family. Hoping to hear from you as soon as
you cash your Bank Draft. Making the world a better place.

Dearest one,

Although we have not met, I got your contact through the internet and decided to contact you for assistance. I was, until recently, a final-year engineering student at the University of Sierra Leone, West Africa. Early last January, the rebels in my country struck our township and killed my parents during one of their attacks. My late father, King Christopher George, being the king of the town, was a prime target. 

Fortunately, I was in school when the attack took place, but I lost my only sister to the rebels. When I returned home for the remains of my parents and their subsequent burial, I discovered a document indicating that my late father had deposited $6 million (six million U.S. dollars) with a private security company in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. This money was meant to fund an auto repair company for me once I completed my studies.

After discovering this, I traveled to Cote d'Ivoire to claim the money as the only surviving next of kin to my father. I have kept my uncles and aunts out of this matter, as they would not be happy knowing that I possess such a large sum of money. I have succeeded in convincing the security company that I am the rightful next of kin, and I now have all the necessary documents.

However, I am not sure what to do next, which is why I am seeking your assistance in transferring the money from the security company to your account. I also need your help to come to your country to continue my education and to invest the money until I am ready to use it. I am truly desperate, as I am now alone in this world.

Please let me know what you would like as compensation for helping me solve this issue. Most importantly, I appeal to you to maintain a high level of secrecy and confidentiality throughout this process.

You can reach me at this number: 00225-075-03684.

Yours sincerely,  
**Kevin George**

On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late Eng. Tony Morris, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter was returned undelivered. I hereby attempt to reach you again by this same email address on the WILL. I wish to notify you that late Eng. Tony Morris made you a beneficiary to his WILL. He left the sum of Two Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (USD$2,200,000.00) to you in the codicil and last testament to his will.

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you, but it is real and true. Being a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who wished you good. Eng. Tony Morris until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers. He was a very dedicated Christian who loved to give out. His great philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his lifetime. Late Eng. Tony Morris died on the 20th day of February 2008 at the age of 92 years and his WILL is now ready for execution.

According to him, this money is to support his Christian activities (May his soul rest with the Lord) and to help the poor and needy.

Please if I reach you as I am hopeful, endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable me to conclude my job. I hope to hear from you in no distant date. Please contact me NOW.

Yours in His service,
Barrister Vikason Ford Esq.

**Judicial Judgements-Child Support BGS**

Thank you for your interest!

**Judgment Courses** offers an extensive training course in ""How to Collect Money Judgments.""

If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income.

If you ever sue a company or a person and you win, then you will have a Money Judgment against them. You are happy you won, but you will soon find out the shocking fact: ""It's now up to you to collect on the Judgment."" The court does not require the loser to pay you. The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts, real estate, stocks, and bonds, etc.

Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found. The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten. ""In 79% of the cases, the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime.""

The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions. Right now in the United States, there is between **$200 billion** and **$300 billion** of uncollected Money Judgment debt. For every Judgment that is paid, **five more** Judgments take its place.

We identified this massive market **eight years ago** and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this business. We have perfected it into a well-proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed.

With our first-hand experience, we have built a course that teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.

By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort, you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments.

The income potential is substantial in this profession. We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full-time making **$96,000** to over **$200,000** per year. Part-time associates are earning between **$24,000** and **$100,000** per year. Some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable organization of **15 to 25 people** in attractive business offices.

Today, our company and our associates have over **$126 million** in Money Judgments that we are currently processing. Of this, **$25 million** is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates. Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break even when our course is purchased. We make a **12% margin** on the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies, police officers, attorneys, credit agencies, etc., all come to us for reports.

Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between **$5 million** to over **$15 million**. Legally, this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced, our associate must be paid off. The norm is **10% interest compounded annually** on unpaid Money Judgments. Annual interest on **$5 million** at **10%** translates to **$500,000** annually in interest income, not counting the payment of the principal.

Our associates earn half of this amount, or **$250,000** per year. This is just for interest, not counting the principal and not counting the compounding of the interest, which can add substantial additional income. Typically, companies are sold for **10 times** earnings. Just based on simple interest, an associate with **$5 million** in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately **$2.5 million**.

**92%** of all of our associates work out of their home; **43%** are women, and **36%** are part-time.

One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off for a month on vacation, then go. The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return. The Judgments are still in force; they do not disappear.

The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you are. You are not a collection agency.

Simply stated, the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows:

1. Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who to write to)
2. **8% to 11%** of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help. They call you; you don't call them unless you want to.
3. You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to sign which splits every dollar you collect **50% to you and 50% to them.** This applies no matter if the judgment is for **$2,000** or **$2,000,000**.
4. You then go online to our computers to find the debtor and their assets. We offer over **120 powerful reports** to assist you. They range from credit reports from all t",scam,investment,"spam,scam,investment"

**Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter? OLIBYKN How are you doing?**

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel - the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was the best decision I've ever made. PERIOD. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health. I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus' absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100% Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having any success, and just not getting the results you were promised, then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!!

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my pledge to you.

Why we're ""IN THE NEWS"" Every gambler knows that the house always wins in the long run. 
As Steve Wynn once famously said, ""the only way to make money in a casino is to own one"" 

""I made $73,589.00 in my first 6 months, and will double that this time around"" J.Barnes, Norfolk, VA 

""We believe our projections of Internet gambling revenues of $100 to $200 Billion domestically and $200-$400 Billion in the rest of the world is reasonable, even conservative."" The Baker Report

""We didn't realize how many people in our area gambled on-line until we received our first check for $39,789.54"" Steve Rhodes, PA. 

""As an entertainer, I look at the Internet as the future venue for many forms of entertainment. It is a powerful way to bring fun and safe entertainment to millions of people at the same time.""  
Country Singer and online casino owner, Kenny Rogers 

""I was amazed at the number of friends and family that are playing on my Casino, last month I earned over $11,400"" Dave P. IL 

""There's no doubt you are dealing with hundreds of Billions of dollars... the amount of money we're talking is astronomical."" -Wisconsin Attorney General James Doyle on Internet gambling 

""I have over 500 players a month at my casino right now and I am already starting your 65% program"" MD. WI. 

""Net traffic is doubling every 100 days."" U.S. Commerce Department 

""On-line gambling turnovers have the potential to dwarf those of other interactive services, tapping into an existing traditional gambling market valued at over $700 Billion in Europe alone."" Data monitor, a market analyst corporation.

PC Computing Magazine has conservatively estimated that the US Internet gaming market could soon reach $20 billion in annual revenue.

Hello -

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""Tim, enter my name for a free membership.""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

That's all there's to it.

We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely, 

Tim Hopkins

P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.

Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.

Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: sj95@yahoo.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for
both their consumer and business opportunities.

Dear Sir,

I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com


Kind regards,

Stanley Woodwork.",scam,pshing ,"spam,scam,pshing "

1813,1813,spam,"Hello
Dear Sir,

I got your contact due to a serious search for a reliable foreign partner, which made me contact you for assistance in transferring my money to you for investment purposes.

I'm Mr. Ibrahim Jallow, the son of a late Sierra Leonean businessman, Mr. Kulu Jallow. He died two years ago when the Revolutionary United Front rebels (R.U.F) attacked our residence in Makeni, Sierra Leone. Following the ceasefire agreement reached last year with the help of United Nations peacekeeping troops, I used the opportunity to leave the country with a very important document of (US$14,500,000) Fourteen million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars deposited by my late father in a security company in Dakar, Senegal, under my name. This money was realized from diamond exports.

Now, I'm searching for a trusted individual or foreign firm whom I can invest this money with, for I am the next of kin to this money. However, I contact you based on your capability and vast knowledge of international commercial investment. For your assistance and cooperation, I will give you 15% of the total sum realized after the successful transfer of this money.

Please kindly communicate your acceptance of this proposal through this my e-mail address so that we can discuss the modalities of completing this transaction. I count on you greatly for your assistance. Awaiting your earnest response.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Ibrahim Jallow

DEAR SIR,

URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL:

Re: Transfer of $50,000,000.00 USD [FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS].

WE WANT TO TRANSFER TO OVERSEAS [$50,000,000.00] [FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS] FROM A SECURITY COMPANY IN SPAIN. I WANT TO ASK YOU TO QUIETLY LOOK FOR A RELIABLE AND HONEST PERSON WHO WILL BE CAPABLE AND FIT TO PROVIDE EITHER AN EXISTING BANK ACCOUNT OR TO SET UP A NEW BANK ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY, EVEN AN EMPTY ACCOUNT CAN SERVE TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY, AS LONG AS YOU WILL REMAIN HONEST TO ME TILL THE END OF THIS IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. I WANT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN FUTURE.

I AM DOUGLAS SMITH, THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF MAGNUM TRUST INC. MADRID, SPAIN. DURING THE COURSE OF OUR AUDITING, I DISCOVERED A FLOATING FUND IN AN ACCOUNT OPENED IN THE SECURITY COMPANY IN 1990 AND SINCE 1993 NOBODY HAS OPERATED ON THIS ACCOUNT AGAIN. AFTER GOING THROUGH SOME OLD FILES IN THE RECORDS, I DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT DIED WITHOUT A HEIR, HENCE THE MONEY IS FLOATING AND IF I DO NOT REMIT THIS MONEY OUT URGENTLY, IT WILL BE FORFEITED FOR NOTHING.

THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT WAS ""MR. ALLAN P. SEAMAN"", A FOREIGNER AND AN INDUSTRIALIST, AND HE DIED SINCE 1993. NO OTHER PERSON KNOWS ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT OR ANYTHING CONCERNING IT. THE ACCOUNT HAS NO BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT ALLAN P. SEAMAN UNTIL HIS DEATH WAS THE MANAGER OF DIAMOND SAFARI [PTY] S.A.

WE WILL START THE FIRST TRANSFER WITH $20 MILLION DOLLARS [TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS]. UPON SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER WITHOUT ANY DISAPPOINTMENT FROM YOUR SIDE, WE SHALL RE-APPLY FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINING $30 MILLION USD [THIRTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS] INTO YOUR ACCOUNT, BRINGING THE SUM TOTAL TO $50,000,000.00 [FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS].

I AM CONTACTING YOU AS A FOREIGNER BECAUSE THIS MONEY CAN ONLY BE APPROVED TO A FOREIGNER WITH A VALID INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT, DRIVER'S LICENSE, AND FOREIGN ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE MONEY IS IN USD, AND THE FORMER OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT ""MR. ALLAN P. SEAMAN"" WAS A FOREIGNER. I WILL LIKE US TO MEET FACE TO FACE TO SIGN A BINDING AGREEMENT THAT WILL BIND US TOGETHER IN THE BUSINESS. I AM REVEALING ALL THESE TO YOU WITH THE BELIEF THAT YOU WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS BUSINESS. YOU ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY PERSON I AM CONTACTING FOR THE BUSINESS, SO PLEASE REPLY URGENTLY FOR ME TO TELL YOU THE NEXT STEP TO TAKE. YOU SHOULD FORWARD YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT DETAILS THAT WILL BE USED IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY.

YOU WILL HAVE TO GIVE ME THE ASSURANCE WHEN WE MEET THAT THIS MONEY WILL BE INTACT PENDING OUR PHYSICAL ARRIVAL IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR SHARING AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND, WHICH WILL BE 35% FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE, 60% WILL BE FOR US, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE EXPENSES THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY BOTH PARTIES DURING THE COURSE OF THE TRANSFER.

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR EARLIEST RESPONSE. ALL CORRESPONDENCE FOR NOW SHOULD BE EMAIL FOR SECURITY REASONS.

BEST REGARDS,

DOUGLAS SMITH

Opportunity is knocking. Why?

Because mortgage rates are rising.

As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.

Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?

We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.

This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.

Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Take two minutes and use the link(s) below that
works for you. Let us show you how to get more
for yourself and your family. Don't let
opportunity pass you by. Take action now.

**Understand the Operating Environments Your Systems Are In**

Computers, by their very nature, pull air in to keep their parts cool. Their fans work 24/7 keeping cool. The problem with this is over time, dust, dirt, and smoke will build up and damage your computer. 

- **Q Damage Your Computer Chips**
- **Q Destroy the Data on Your Hard Drive**
- **Q Melt the Motherboard**

What does this mean to you? All of your information could be lost forever! All of your files and data—works in progress—and contacts could be destroyed! The information you have saved is a thousand times more valuable than the computer itself. That’s why technicians recommend backups for your data. 

**It’s All Preventable!**

The Pro-Tech Computer Filtration System simply works by filtering the air before it reaches your computer's sensitive internal components. The system is set up at the base of your computer, with 2 easy steps, and is positioned in front of your computer's air intake, filtering 98% of the air particles that would otherwise get into your systems.

For as little as $24.95 plus shipping, you can ensure you are completely protected and never worry about dust, smoke, moisture, etc., damaging your computer again!

---

**Product Availability:**

Please allow up to 10 days for delivery. Pro-Tech will do everything we can to ship your order as soon as possible and notify you of the estimated time of delivery.

**For Great Rates on Quantity and Wholesale Pricing:**

Order 5 or more and receive a 10% discount! Wholesale orders save up to 20% or more!

Pro-Tech uses UPS Ground for shipping and handling: $5.85.

Pro-Tech prides itself on protecting consumers' financial privacy and safety. No more cans of air, no more bags, no more computer vacuums. Perfect for home, office, and industry.

**Models:**
- Model #1: $24.95
- Model #2: $29.95
- Model #3: $36.95

Our systems are fully adjustable and will fit any computer—one size fits all. Installs in seconds!

**Installation Steps:**
1. Place the base of the filtration system onto your computer.
2. Place the top of the filtration system onto the base.

You’re all set; and you can access your disk drives as needed.

- 1 size filter fits all three systems.
- A package of 4 large heavy-duty HEPA filters, micron rated and designed to last up to 6 months: $9.85 (perfect for industry).

Hello,

Please accept my sincere apologies if my email does not align with your personal ethics.

I would like to introduce myself as Mr. Lang Owen, a staff member in the Accounts Management section of the above firm here in the United Kingdom.

One of our accounts, holding a balance of £15,000,000 (fifteen million British pounds), has been dormant and has not been operated for the past four (4) years. 

From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a foreigner named Kurt Kahle, passed away in July 2000. Since then, nobody has taken action regarding the claiming of these funds, as he had no family members who were aware of the existence of either the account or the funds.

I have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of our company, and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to assist us. We propose to conduct business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these funds from the deceased, allowing the funds to be released to you after due processes have been followed.

This transaction is completely free of risk, as the funds are legitimate and do not originate from drug-related activities, money laundering, terrorism, or any other illegal actions. Upon receiving your response, I will provide you with detailed clarification regarding this mutually beneficial transaction.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible if you are interested.

Best regards,  
Mr. Lang Owen

Hi,

Do you receive emails every day offering to show you how to make money? Most of these emails come from people who aren’t making any money themselves, yet they expect you to listen to them. 

If you want to make real money with your computer, you should connect with a group that is actually doing it. We are generating a substantial, ongoing income every month, and we can show you how to do the same! 

This business is conducted entirely online, and you can even join for free to check it out first. If you can send an email, you can do this—no special skills required!

**How much can you make?** Anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 per month! We are real people, and most of us work on this business part-time. Keep in mind, we do put in the effort. 

I won’t insult your intelligence by claiming you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash. That kind of opportunity doesn’t exist. However, if you’re willing to put in 5-10 hours per week, this might be exactly what you’re looking for. 

This is not income determined by luck or work done for you. It’s all based on your effort, but as I mentioned, no special skills are required. Plus, this income is residual, meaning it continues each month and tends to increase!

**Interested?** I invite you to find out more. You can join as a free member at no cost and with no obligation to continue if it’s not for you. We’re just looking for people who still have that burning desire to find a rewarding opportunity.

To grab a free ID and receive more information, simply go to [your website URL] and send me an email with the following information:
- Your First Name
- Your Last Name
- Your Email Address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report along with your free member number.

If you’re not interested in earning money but are looking for huge discounts from various online shops, cheap ISP packages, and many more offers, you can also go to [your website URL]—it’s all there.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,  
Hugh Zou

P.S. After several negative experiences with network marketing companies, I had pretty much given up on them. This is different—there’s value, integrity, and a real opportunity to have your own home-based business and finally make real money on the internet. Don’t pass this up; you can sign up and test drive the program for free!

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mrs. Mariam M. Sese Seko, widow of the late President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I write to you in confidence due to my current circumstances.

After escaping from the DRC with my husband and two sons, James Kongolo and Nzanga, we initially settled in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, before moving to Morocco. Sadly, my husband passed away due to cancer. 

Due to the political situation, we decided to secure my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss banks and other countries, converting them into a coded form for safety. The new head of state, Mr. Laurent Kabila, has made arrangements to freeze my late husband's assets. As a result, we have been living discreetly in Africa while monitoring the situation.

Currently, I have deposited **$18 million USD** with a security company for safekeeping. I seek your assistance in receiving these funds on our behalf. My son Kongolo has the necessary modalities to claim the funds, and I would like him to introduce you to the process.

I am interested in investing this money in real estate and stocks in multinational companies, and I would greatly appreciate your advice on safe and non-speculative investments. 

I want to emphasize the importance of confidentiality in this project and trust that you will respect our privacy. If you are willing to assist us, my son Kongolo will provide you with further details regarding the project, including where the funds are currently maintained and the remuneration for your services.

Please provide your contact information, including your personal telephone number and fax number, for validation purposes. I kindly ask you to acknowledge receipt of this email.

Thank you for your understanding.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Sese Seko

**Introduction**  
We sell backup CDs, also known as warez CDs. Backup CDs are copies of software. For example, if you go into a shop and buy Windows XP Pro for about NUMBER, you get the serial, the CD, the box, and the manual. If you order it off us, you get the Windows XP CD and the serial number. It works exactly the same, but you don’t get the manual and box, and the price is only NUMBER. That is a saving of NUMBER, and the only difference is you don’t have a colorful box and manual, which are not very useful features.

- Over NUMBER applications
- Over NUMBER games

We reply to all your requests in a few hours.  
Newest releases, we have the best price on the web, best choice of CDs ever seen on the web.  
We ship orders worldwide. Secure credit card processing through our authorized online retailer. Your information will be passed through a secure server and encrypted (NUMBER-bit). No need to worry about someone stealing your credit card details.

Hello, 
Premium Phone Qualified 
Business Opportunity Leads
If you're spending money marketing a Business Opportunity or MLM,
you will definitely be interested in 
what we have to offer you. 
You're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having 
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.Â  Sometimes
calling 100 people without one single signup!Â  Sometimes 
talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches
to the point of them hanging up when you call!Â  (Leads oversold)
We're here to help! 
We'll get you qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity. 
Period. 
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. 
We'll do it quickly, and professionally. 
And we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!Here's How We Generate Our Leads...
- All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!
- One source we use for Lead-generation is a Business Opportunity
Seeker Lead List of people who have requested info. about making 
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.Â  If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).Â  Never more than 24 hours old.Â  Guaranteed!
- We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name, 
Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!Â  However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are Super-Fresh!Â  Delivered in Real-Time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!Â  (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're Targeted.Â  Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're Highly Receptive!Â  Receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!Â  Also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.Â  Especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. No ""feast or famine"" activity.Â  Leads will be coming in 
regularly.Â  You dictate the flow!
6. No more cold calls!Â  We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each Lead!
8. Save Time.Â  Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. Lower ""burnout"" factor.Â  Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due 
to higher closing ratios.Â  Of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of 
""quick successes"".
12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.Â  Just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!
These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!Â  And we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!Start Generating As Many SIGN-UPS as You Can Handle!
Explode Your Downline and Income!

co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.

**80% to 95% BELOW WHOLESALE**  
**NEW, AND IN QUANTITIES YOU NEED**  
Whether you need a single unit, a pallet, or a truckload.

1. Are you looking for a real business that can provide you and your family with the lifestyle you desire? Or perhaps just a second income in your spare time?  
2. Would you invest $66.50 (a 33% discount off our regular price of $99.95 during this limited-time advertisement) in a business that could make you ""FINANCIALLY SECURE"" by buying at up to 95% below wholesale and selling at 100% to 500%+ over your cost?  

If so, read on:

This is not a get-rich-quick scheme, but a way to enter a business with minimal investment that may be your first step towards a rewarding income. For a long time, only those who could make large investments had the chance to take advantage of this type of business. We have made it possible for everyone to participate at a price everyone can afford.

Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from employment. Yet, layoffs are at an all-time high, and major corporations are failing. We hope to never become victims of downsizing, career burnout, illness, or injury.

Finding another job used to be easy, but today, many people find that ""the plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives."" The economy has moved from the industrial age into the INFORMATION, SERVICE, AND RETAIL AGE. You can no longer depend on corporations to provide job security for your family; we all need a backup plan. If you are TIRED OF LIVING FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK and are willing to work a few hours per week, this may be for you.

**Please read further:**

We will show you how to buy new, not outdated, products for PENNIES on the WHOLESALE DOLLAR. We won’t just send you a list or catalog of where to buy; we provide an actual point-and-click DATABASE with hyperlinks to suppliers' websites and specials pages, including email addresses, phone and fax numbers, and their current HOT listings. Unlike other distribution businesses that provide outdated catalogs or lists of government auctions (which are often myths), we offer an unlimited virtual database of items at up to 95% below wholesale from liquidators, not wholesalers. This database is updated weekly or even daily by the suppliers. The products are available for immediate purchase and shipping to you, guaranteed for 30 days with a full refund if they do not meet our claims.

This database is designed for individuals or small businesses. Although some suppliers sell in large quantities, most are selected for their flexibility to sell in smaller quantities at great savings (80% to 95% below wholesale).

You will have access to buy items like RCA Stereos that retail for $250.00+ for $10 to $20.00, New Boom Boxes for $12.50 each, Palm Pilots for $39.00, Cell Phone Antenna Boosters advertised on TV for $19.95 for only $0.16, Perfect Pancake Makers for $6.50, CDs for $0.75 each, Pentium computers for as little as $11.00, or Computer Software that retails up to $74.99 for only $0.50 each.

If you would like to see some sample listings and featured specials, please email us at moreof80to95@themail.com.

**You may purchase this database:**

- **By Credit Card**: PayPal to the account of datapaid2000@yahoo.com  
- **By Phone**: Credit Card at 502-741-8154  
- **Check by Fax To**: Specialty Products 502-244-1373 (Just write a check and fax it; NO NEED TO MAIL. Please include your email address for the database transmission.)  
- **By Mail**:  
  Specialty Products

  Louisville, KY 40245  
  (Please remember to include a valid email address for the database transmission.)

For your protection, we provide a **30-DAY, 100% MONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE** if we have misrepresented our product.

**What do you get for your $66.50 investment?**  
During advertisement A, you will receive a fully executable database (within 24 hours or less) of hundreds of suppliers with hyperlinks to their websites, fax and phone numbers, and descriptions of the types of products they handle and their current specials. You will also have ongoing telephone support during normal business hours.

Since this is a fast-changing business, with new products being added and deleted regularly, all data will be provided within 24 hours of receipt of payment via email file transfer (no waiting or shipping and handling costs). The $66.50 is your total one-time cost during this advertisement.

This DATABASE is for individuals who recognize an opportunity to earn substantial income. Everyone loves a bargain, especially during economic downturns. Even if you just want to buy for personal use, a single purchase could repay your initial investment. Remember, we provide a 30-day full refund satisfaction guarantee.",scam,investment,"spam,scam,investment"

DEPARTMENT OF ABSA BANK LIMITED. IN MY DEPARTMENT, WE DISCOVERED AN 
ABANDONED SUM OF US$12.5,000,000 (Twelve POINT FIVE MILLION US 
DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE 
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO 
THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, 
NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS MONEY. 
  
IT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT AND I HAVE

TREASURY ACCOUNT. 
  
NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 
2002. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF-KIN 
IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A 
FOREIGNER. 
  
THE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT: 60% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED

YOU ARE GETTING THIS EMAIL BECAUSE YOU ARE ON A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT WANT ALL THE MONEY THEY CAN SPEND WITHOUT WORKING FOR IT. YOU WILL ONLY GET THIS ONCE, SO PLEASE DO NOTHING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE REMOVED! (By doing nothing, you will automatically be removed). We really are looking for TRULY lazy people that dream about being able to do what they want, when they want AND DO SO WITHOUT WORKING. We want the type of people that drive by a house and say that they want that house someday, but would love to own that house through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation. We want the type of people that would like to send their children to ""Harvard"" or ""Stanford"" and have these educations paid for through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation. We want the type of people that see a new T-Bird, Corvette, or Jaguar and want to own these cars and have them paid for through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation. We want the type of people that on a whim want to travel to maybe Maui in the winter or Alaska in the summer and while there, if they choose to buy a home in either place, they can do so through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation. We want the people that would like to sleep till noon if they choose to or get up and go to the country club to play golf if they choose to, and do so because they always have a stream of income through money generated while they sleep or while they are on vacation. We want the type of people that truly hate the thought of getting up in the morning and making money for someone else. We want the type of people that deep down want to tell some snob that thinks he's a big deal because he or she drives a Mercedes, that the Rolls Royce that you are driving is paid for, and tomorrow you might buy yourself a Porsche, and if you are in the mood to, you might buy your wife or friend a BMW. In other words, you deep down want to tell the snobs of the world that they really are managing their debt, but you have what you want when you want, and you have it all with no debt, and you have all of this through money generated while you sleep or while you are on vacation. Seriously, if you want more money than you can spend and you really, truly DO NOT WANT TO WORK, then you are the type of person we are looking for. If you would like to know why some people can do this... then simply send a blank email with the words: ""I HATE TO WORK"" in the subject area to: ihatetowork99@yahoo.com. After doing so, you will be contacted in less than 24 hours and learn how to get the house you want, the education for your children that you would like them to have, go on the vacation you want, when you want, all through money generated while you sleep or while you are playing golf or while you are on vacation. Also, we do not want you to hear from us again if the idea of making all the money you want is not exciting to you. Therefore, this is the first and last email you will get unless we hear from you... so if you want TO GET RICH without working, then simply send a blank email with the words: ""I HATE TO WORK"" in the subject area to: ihatetowork99@yahoo.com.

CONSANTLY being
bombarded by so-called “FREE” money-making systems that teases you with limited
information, and when it’s all said and done, blind-sides you by demanding your
money/credit card information upfront in some slick way, after-the-fact!
Yes, I too was as skeptical about such offers and the Internet in general with
all its hype, as you probably are. Fortunate for me, my main business
slowed-down (I have been self-employed all my life), so I looked for
something to fit my lifestyle and some other way to assist me in paying my
bills, without working myself to death or loosing more money; then, this
proposal to try something new without any upfront investment (great! because
I had none) interested me to click on the link provided. And I don’t regret
at all that I did! I am very happy, and happy enough to recommend it to you as
a system that is true to its word. I mean absolutely no upfront money. You join
only if (when) you make money. You also get to track the results of your
time and efforts instantly and updated daily! I especially liked this idea of
personal control with real-time, staying informed statistics.
This system is quite simply
the most logical, opened, and fair of any others that I’ve seen before. Why?
Because from the start, you get all the specific facts you need to seriously
consider if this is right for you.  No teasing. No grand testimonies! No
kidding! Just the facts! Unlike in other programs that give you “no idea” of
their overall plan before first forking over your money/credit card; or worst
yet, joining and finding-out too late, after wasting valuable time trying to
figure them out, this system is straightforward and informative, providing you
with the two things you really must know: “What’s it all about?” and “How
does it work?”. These are the ultimate deal makers or deal breakers that
need to be immediately disclosed, well before discovering that maybe you don’t
want to do that; by then you are “hooked” and now locked into a frustrating
battle to try to get your money back! 
I call this my “Platinum
Choice” because it stands alone as a true, superior deal that is totally
different from previously misleading, “hook-first” programs that promise lofty
mega-money jackpots, but really just want your money upfront to line their own
pockets! You’ve seen the headlines: “Join free and Make $10,000 every week
for life” yeah, right!
I did not make millions yet,
but the whole thing was launched just a few weeks ago and I am more than happy
with my earnings, so far. I must tell you, I wouldn’t be able to do anything
without corporate help – which was unusually thorough, timely, and motivating. 
You have to see this in action
for yourself and make up your own mind; just go to my site and fill out the
form as soon as you can. You will get your own site in a few minutes. Then you
are ready to try whether you can make some decent money with this system and
the Internet’s explosive potential - fully loaded with hi-tech software, free
corporate help, on-time member’s support and even protective safeguards! 
Get it now, and you can call me
at any time with questions. It really could help you like it is helping me to
finally be able to pay my bills, and keep my free time free.  Good luck!

Strictly confidential.

I am pleased to introduce myself to you. My name is Mr. Wilson Kamela, a native of South Africa and a senior employee of the Mines and Natural Resources Department, currently on a training course in Holland for a few months.

I am writing this letter to request your assistance in order to redeem an investment with the South African Mining Corporation. The said investment, now valued at $15.5 million dollars (fifteen million, five hundred thousand dollars only), was purchased by Lucio Harper and contracted out to the South African Mining Corporation in 1977, now recognized as the Mines and Natural Resources Department. This redeemable investment interest has matured since March last year.

Since March last year, several attempts have been made to contact Lucio Harper without success, and there is no way to contact any of his close relatives in whose favor the investment cash value can be paid. Since we have access to all of Lucio Harper's information, we can claim this money with the help of my partners at the South African Mines and Natural Resources Department. All we have to do is file a claim using you as Lucio Harper's relative.

I would like to assure you that there is absolutely nothing to worry about, as it is perfectly safe with no risk involved. Please ensure to keep this matter strictly confidential. My partner will file a claim for this money on your behalf from the South African Mining Corporation. When the claim is approved, you, as the beneficiary, will be paid 25% of the total amount.

Since this money can be paid directly into any bank account of your choice, you have the responsibility to ensure that my partner and I receive 70% of the total amount, while the balance (5%) will be set aside for any unforeseen expenses in the course of transferring this money.

I would appreciate it if you can give your assurance and guarantee that our share will be well secured. For the sake of confidentiality, please reach me at my email address: wilsonkamela3000@mail.com. Let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you. Kindly reach me immediately with any of the stated contact addresses so that better clarifications relating to the transaction will be explained to you.

1968,1968,spam,"Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. Well needless telling a very long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the Southern African region of the African continent.

The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme commander, the late Dr. Jonas Savimbi, was killed in an encounter with the government forces of the MPLA government of my country. The rest is now history but suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland. I have therefore decided to pull out my troops from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise. I am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at least for the interim period until I am sufficiently sure that I would be welcome home wholeheartedly by the MPLA government in Luanda, the capital of Angola.

Needless to say, I was the single most important commander who was very close to the late supreme commander; Dr. Jonas Savimbi. Indeed, because I am a brother to one of his wives, he confided in me a great deal. The result of such trust is my reason for contacting you. I was the commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of thirty-two million USD ($32 million) with a security/finance company in South Africa. This was immediately after the events of September 11, 2001, in the United States of America.

Indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world, particularly for a liberation movement like UNITA, hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in South Africa. I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and deposited with the said security/finance company as cash in hundred dollar denominations. The money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of continuing the civil war in Angola.

The supreme commander is dead, and as already stated, I have decided to quit the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other commanders may wish to continue! I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32 million. I am still in the bush here but I have been able to establish contact with the company in South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to take possession of the money that I kept with them.

Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign national who is the head of a mining company in Angola (never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to cooperate with me over this, I am willing to give you 20% of the $32 million. Please come back to me through email: edum@hkem.com. The security/finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32 million.

Finally, you are to note that in your reply, you are to state your residential or company address and, if possible, send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands.

Yours truly,
Eduado de Mello

1970,1970,spam,"Dear Sir/Ma,

I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State, General Sanni Abacha, who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other, likely developing a cordial relationship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash, which I intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country’s multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after his death and lodged it in my husband's security company of which I am the director right now. The new civilian government has intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company.

In view of these, I acted fast to withdraw the US$35,000,000.00 from the company’s vault and deposited it in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the security company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website: www.thisdayonline.com, click on archives, 8th June 2001.

The present government in Nigeria has frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us to discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, and 10% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction.

Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential, whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, I have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy. Remember to include your private telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney, Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.

REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to its treasury millions of dollars of unclaimed deceased depositors' funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with reference to my bank, WEMA BANK PLC., the money normally runs into several millions of dollars.

Until Dr. David Fang's death along with his wife, Doris, and their two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane crash, I was his foreign currency-denoted bank account manager with a constant balance in excess of eight digits. Ever since his death and up to this time of writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come forward to claim his money with us. Naturally, as long as the late Dr. David Fang's money remains unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with his money.

However, with my being in direct charge of Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance Department of my bank, I am in a position to cause the payment of this money to whosoever presents himself as the next of kin or relation of the late Dr. David Fang on a private business deal basis.

Now, the game plan and the purpose of writing to you exclusively, having been highly recommended as the right and proper person to handle this deal by a management consultant friend of mine, who has traveled widely, including your country, is that I want to pull out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000.00 (Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars) with your cooperation and assistance by just doing the following:

(a) Act as the next of kin or relation of late Dr. David Fang
(b) Provide your bank account and location where you want the money remitted
(c) Provide your direct and private telephone/fax numbers for effective communication
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the above Tel/Fax number for details on how to proceed.
For your cooperation and efforts, 40% of the money will be for you as my foreign partner, 10% for settlement of all expenses that might be incurred in the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for myself that will eventually visit your country for disbursement of the fund.

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business relationship.

Regards,
RONARD TONY.

With good recommendation, I decided to contact you. I am Prince David Savimbi, the son of Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the UNITA rebel group in Angola, who was killed in February by troops loyal to the government. After his funeral and burial, we had a family meeting and resolved to invest the money he left behind in your country; hence this letter to you.

He left the sum of $30 million US dollars in cash, which was a proceed from the sale of diamonds under his control. However, the entire development made us flee Angola to Johannesburg, South Africa, for fear of being killed. The amount of $30 million in cash is presently in our possession, and I would want it to be invested in your country due to the stability of your economy.

The money is currently with an emergency diplomatic security courier company, which my mother and I hurriedly used to move the cargo out from our country to South Africa. We registered it under a security code with no name and registered it as containing photographic paper material.

My mother and I have resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your assistance in getting these funds transferred to your reliable company’s account in your country for investment. We have also resolved to spend the rest of our lives in your country.

I have to make travel arrangements to come to Johannesburg, South Africa, immediately to meet with you face-to-face and see the funds physically, then have it transferred to your account. Afterward, both of us would travel together to your country for sharing and immediate investment, and my family will join me later.

Dear Sir,

I am Barrister Williams Falana, a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business Encyclopaedia; hence I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of us. 

The sum of USD 48 million United States dollars was lodged into a security company here in the country by the late head of state Gen. Sani Abacha for safe keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults, boxes, and labelled as personal belongings, and as such, the security company does not know the true content of the boxes. 

This money was originally meant to be used for his political campaign because I was his family attorney. As such, he confided in me with the relevant document papers relating to this deposit before he died of cardiac arrest. 

As a matter of fact, we have concluded all arrangements with an offshore security company to move this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore affiliated office, where you will be required to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide beneficiary. 

You should know that this business is safe and risk-free, as it does not involve drug money or terrorist funding. If you are interested in carrying out this transaction with me, $10 million will be for you for your assistance, $5 million for general expenses, and $33 million for us. 

You are required to send by email immediately your full name and address, which I will use to draft an agreement that will guide and protect both of us in this transaction, also which will be used to effect the change of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary. 

Also, send me your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. Once you notify me of your willingness by sending the above requirements, this transaction will be concluded within seven working days. 

I will be waiting for your urgent response. You can reach me on my cell telephone no. +234 123 456 7890 or my alternative email williamsfalana@example.com.

Due to the ongoing conflict concerning land ownership in Zimbabwe, particularly the government's stance against white farmers under President Robert Mugabe, my family has faced significant challenges. My father, although Black, served as the treasurer of the Farmers Association and was a staunch opponent of the President's policies. Unfortunately, as a result of his position, he was targeted, and tragically, he lost his life when members of the ruling party and local police invaded our family farm.

Following my father's death, our local pastor, a close family friend, provided us with my father's will, which includes instructions for us to leave Zimbabwe for our safety. The will also includes a certificate of deposit from a security company, which holds a significant amount of money that was deposited under the guise of personal belongings. The total amount is USD [insert amount].

We are reaching out to solicit your assistance in relocating these funds out of Zimbabwe. Given the current political climate and restrictions on international transactions, our future remains uncertain, and we fear for our safety.

We have a plan in place to facilitate the transfer of these funds within two weeks, and we believe it can be carried out confidentially and without risk. In exchange for your assistance, we are willing to offer you [insert percentage]% of the total amount upon confirmation of the funds in an account of your choosing.

When studying XFS code (2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get ACL, which may cause a deadlock.
Because when getting ACL, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP. If the memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may lock (XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) the same inode again. If between these two locks, another process tries to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two processes will be deadlocked. As follows:

A process gets EA B process wants to lock ipA

xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) .....................

get ACL 2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL)

memory tight

|
xfs_strategy

xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE) ............................
These two processes will be deadlocked.

So I believe that ACL allocation GFP_MASK should be changed to KM_NOFS. Right?

Hello SourceForge.net Users,

This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.

Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:

http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html

How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.

Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.

If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.

Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.

Pat-

Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net

EMAIL LIST REMOVAL:

When the SF.NET team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)"".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume"".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.

{624 Kurt Eisner, ""bayerischer Partikularist""} 

Indem Kurt Eisner der revolutionaren Erhebung in Bayern eine ganz bewu.te Spitze gegen das ubrige 
Reich gab, handelte er nicht im geringsten aus bayerischen Gesichtspunkten heraus, sondern nur als 
Beauftragter des Judentums. Er benutzte die vorhandenen Instinkte und Abneigungen des bayerischen 
Volkes, um mittels ihrer Deutschland leichter zerschlagen zu konnen. Das zertrummerte Reich aber 
ware spielend eine Beute des Bolschewismus geworden. 

Die von ihm angewandte Taktik wurde auch nach seinem Tod zunachst fortgefuhrt. Der Marxismus, der 
gerade die Einzelstaaten und ihre Fursten in Deutschland immer mit blutigstem Hohn ubergossen hatte, 
appellierte als ""Unabhangige Partei"" nun plotzlich eben an diejenigen Gefuhle und Instinkte, die in 
Furstenhausern und Einzelstaaten ihre starkste Wurzel hatten. 

Der Kampf der Raterepublik gegen die anruckenden Befreiungskontingente war in erster Linie als 
""Kampf bayerischer Arbeiter"" gegen den ""preu.ischen Militarismus"" propagandistisch aufgezogen 
worden. Nur daraus kann man auch verstehen, warum in Munchen, ganz zum Unterschied von anderen 
deutschen Gebieten, das Niederwerfen der Raterepublik nicht zur Besinnung der breiten Massen, 
sondern vielmehr zu einer noch gro.eren Verbitterung und Verbissenheit gegen Preu.en fuhrte.

,2023,spam, foreword after thirty three years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young african american men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young african americans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young african american culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows we are a group of people born between NUMBER and NUMBER we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations it s that simple it seems we have come to be called xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse we are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one our mothers they also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identity there are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggs s documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for b e t black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior regarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been it s funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent african american perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all african americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class african americans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what i m attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary don t feel bad there were several times i had to as well regarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of african american culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy in my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in u s penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most african americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called i m still fly shown in heavy rotation on b e t and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty its signature verse asserts i got gator boots with a pimped out gucci suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s o k cause i m still fly worse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on b e t is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and patty cake patty cake i m the bakers man i bake them cakes as fast as i can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and i disguise it as rap so the feds backup in this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references i ve identified have become an integral part of the urban african american existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the african american community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to african americans in four different ways the first being african americans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one african american man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy in the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every african american woman s fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and

machine while living NUMBER hours a day in a space just NUMBER feet by eight feet on a diet of scrubs grub and at virtually no cost the book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without

mag i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it is the opening paragraph penned by bronson it s a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal you can t help feeling he has a point this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars having already published birdman opens his mind which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majesty s pleasure jimmy boyle the scots sculptor and novelist discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prison s famous special unit which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of babs rooney in NUMBER once released he moved to edinburgh where he has become a respected artist his first novel hero of the underworld was published in NUMBER and his autobiography a sense of freedom was made into an award winning film hugh collins was jailed for life in NUMBER for the murder of william mooney in glasgow and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers earning him an extra seven year sentence but after being transferred to the same unit that boyle attended he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art he later published autobiography of a murderer a frank account of glasgow s criminal culture in the NUMBERs which received critical praise and lord archer doesn t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail he recently signed a three book deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported NUMBER million and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak so why is it that men like collins bronson and boyle who can be so destructive towards society on the outside can become so creative once stuck on the inside steve richards bronson s publisher has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound he says prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education if their early years have been hard it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents however richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that he says once they are behind bars the cold light of day hits them and they examine the very essence of who they are they ask themselves am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence or am i a man who can contribute to society who can be remembered for something good bronson who was born michael gordon peterson but changed his name to that of the hollywood star of the death wish films has so far been remembered mainly for things bad he was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in NUMBER and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison in NUMBER he was jailed for life after

metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to NUMBER NUMBER yes NUMBER NUMBER press ups a day as he puts it i can hit a man NUMBER times in four seconds i can push NUMBER press ups in NUMBER seconds but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise solitary fitness might be the book which will see bronson s face sitting on every coffee table in the land he might be the man to give us the dream body which so many so called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into because bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists all this crap about high protein drinks pills diets it s just a load of bollocks and a multi million pound racket he writes in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style we can all be fat lazy bastards it s our choice i m sick of hearing and reading about excuses if you stuff your face with shit you become shit that s logical to me as motivational mantras go that might be just the kick up the er

,2087,ham, URL hamza s horrid but we must tolerate him rod liddle wednesday august NUMBER NUMBER the guardian sheikh abu hamza al masri our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park hackney i ve often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays head for the beach and maybe swing by b q on the way home i had hoped i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea an ice cream cone in his one good hand the waves tickling his shins and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you too but b q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza s budget since the bank of england froze his assets so victoria park had to do but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him with the babble of tiny cheerful islamic proto warriors in the background you must know hamza he s the imam designed it would seem by the daily mail s cartoonist mac large metal hook in place of a left hand one eye covered by a patch the other a baleful watchful milky white we don t mock the disabled any more these days unless it s someone like hamza whom we don t like then if you ll excuse the inapt phraseology the gloves come off so hamza is known with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right as captain hook in articles which usually call for his arrest or extradition to the us or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities anywhere really just out of here and if we can t lock him up or chuck him out of the country maybe we can force him to shut up because we don t like hamza very much we weren t that fond of him before september NUMBER but afterwards in that nervy paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in our disapprobation turned into political persecution and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they ve got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam all out of context and a very long time ago says the imam not unduly bothered but perhaps he should be because our reputation for broad mindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror s scoop hamza preaches or preached at the scary finsbury park mosque so earlier this year the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks i didn t know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen he is tailed by the police every now and then and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press and this last point is because we tell ourselves endlessly repeating the mantra over and over again and fervently wishing it to be true hamza is not representative of british muslims as if british muslims were a simple homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation and perhaps succour the trouble is in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more representative than the list of those government approved muslim spokesmen who were uncomfortably i suspect dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban an opinion poll commissioned by radio NUMBER s today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush s crusade one in six were to put it mildly ambivalent about the attack on the us the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam which is what hamza said repeatedly but it was something that at the time we didn t want to hear now if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across superficially at least as someone from the liberal left no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth nor is he particularly anti semitic so far as i can tell although i don t suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year in yesterday s guardian the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh s message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is without question rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy in a truly islamic society to stone women to death for adultery for example you and i would find many perhaps most of his views utterly repellent and that s the point because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural multiculturalism is not surely the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism multiculturalism is rather the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture and maybe learn from them the fbi has been investigating hamza but of course has found nothing remotely incriminating the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally this is a perfectly noble argument but it does not wash you don t defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn t exist and if british muslims maybe a minority maybe not feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza shutting the man up therefore won t make a difference it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by hour the glass will fall for ever but if you break the bloody glass you won t hold up the weather yahoo groups sponsor NUMBER dvds free s p join now URL to unsubscribe from this group send an email to

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.

If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.

Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

A good plan, needs an implementation though:

hmm. seems down to me.  Basically it's a plan to store hash sums of

look up.  A little like spamcop's ""spamvertized URL"" list...

It will function as a router if that is what you wish.

It even looks like the modem's embedded OS is some kind of linux, being that
it has interesting interfaces like eth0.

I don't use it as a router though.... I just have it do the absolute minimum
DSL stuff and do all the really fun stuff like pppoe on my linux box........

Also the manual tells you what the default password is.

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundred-thousand-hectares).

It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world. Maybe they're downloading Bjork videos.

I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.

A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...",normal,,"ham,normal,"

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Sorry, that just can't work.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.

Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.

Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.

The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

Not true on the choice part.

After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.

I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....

Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I
wanted....................................

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...

to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence.

only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  

After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:

    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,

    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and

* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.

To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.

""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread 
applications.""

We've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5

GB/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly GB files) with random 
deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store).

are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.

        ""A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .

        ""There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.

        ""(1) He considers himself a genius.

        ""(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .

        ""(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .

        ""(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .

        ""(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . .""

I found this interesting, but not very original. Another search engine 
(can't remember which one tho') was doing this a long time ago.

Postcards from Planet Google

INTERNET: The search engine is taking snapshots of its users' minds and 
aggregating them. So what is the world thinking about?

JENNIFER 8. LEE

At Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, 
transfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the 
receptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es 
et poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.

The projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what 
people around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The 
terms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, 
French, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.

The scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a 
cigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto 
theft fraud how to.

Stare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the 
collective consciousness of the world stream by.

Each line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet 
connection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more 
than 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer 
logs millisecond by millisecond.

Google is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.

So what is the world thinking about?

Sex, for one thing.

``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking 
at the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. 
(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, 
though less successfully with foreign languages.)

Despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much 
of its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble 
to the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.

``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what 
they are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of 
Google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and 
protecting the data record.

Google's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has 
given Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has 
been able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including 
milzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell 
which countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and 
Germany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the 
globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are 
far-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.

Judging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost 
everywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race 
and the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last 
year. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music 
and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a 
Google engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney 
Spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her 
popularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of 
the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.

Glancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural 
literacy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and 
girlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list 
recently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose 
members was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and 
fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages 
taken by Chechen rebels in late October).

The long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney 
Spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them 
understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she 
broke up with Justin Timberlake.

Google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more 
serious nature, immediately.

On Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 
am local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to 
250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific 
Northwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and 
CNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, 
Nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that 
Nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.

But the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive 
cultural seismic meter.

The logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden 
name'' had surged to the top of the charts.

Curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they 
were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes 
after the hour.

As the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. 
Why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s 
sitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not 
explain them.

That is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena 
per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.

``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a 
member of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what 
else is going on in the world.''",normal,,"ham,normal,"

I think I understand the feeling.  A few years ago I caught up with
a couple of old fianc�s, both now authors and notable in their
field.  One is a minor celebrity - perhaps I should say 'was'
because fame can be so fleeting and I do not know the
current status but she still commands buck$ on the lecture
circuit.  I authored some technical material through the
years which are probably long forgotten.  I am also 'notable',
sort of, kind of, in some very narrow fields (how many
mando-bass artists could there be?) so have that
feather in my cap if I cared about it.

I feel I am only a little jealous or depressed thinking about my
own accomplishments (or lack thereof) - what does
bug me is that these 2 probably have some real good
juicy stories and I'm not getting to hear any of them!!
That's one reason I love this list...

Ray Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related
events, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State
construction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest
home.

It was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallace�s
company building a new road through the northern California forest.   In
August through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew
found tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from
taxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint
from this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called �Bigfoot.�  Crew
took the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt
County newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant
plaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a
revolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to today�s
global awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace
and his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;
Wallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.

Wallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest
of his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace
offered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace
failed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down
through the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake
Sasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.
He was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors
about this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby
guarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and
researchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through
his contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to
Fate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the
Bigfoot mystery.

In March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who
could bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for
forty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to
adulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with
�care and respect� and would like to train the creature to ride around with
him in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one
came forth with a baby Bigfoot.

Ray Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to
the otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,
such as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.

Ray Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington
State, on November 30, 2002.

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello

Dear Friend
 
 I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former
 President 
 of the Congo Republic. I am presently under
protective custody
 in Nigeria
 as
a political refugee. I got your contact over the internet during my
search for a
 stranger
 that
can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.i took this option because my family friends and associates cpuld not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present predicament.
 
I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us.
 However, 
you must confirm your ability to handle this because
it involves
 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is
my share of
 my
 father's
estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security
company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:

1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you
will keep the
transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence
number for
 identification
to the security company.
4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your full permanent address.
 
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose
 to 
you the name and the country of the security company.
I will
 forward your
name and particulars to the security company to enable
 them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF
AUTHORITY to
 enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very
safe
 transaction as
this money is my share of my father'sestate.
 
 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

cdyv positioned as likely takeover candidate by the
always acquisition - minded leaders of the publishing
industry capturing sales of 20 billion .
cdyv is the leading advertising , printing , and publishing
company in texas specializing in the very high - profit
sector of community - based weekly publications . as master
publisher for the state of texas , cdyv reaches 22 million
people , 254 counties , and over 3 , 100 towns and cities
with their tidbits publication featuring local
advertising in dozens of areas including entertainment ,
real estate / housing , consumer goods and services , and
major retailers like walgreens and dollar general .
cdyv has been in business 4 years and has grown quickly ,
now it is time for them to explode in the public markets .
cdyv is new to the stock market , having gone public in a
very quiet manner . so you have a very brief period to
get in at or near the bottom before share prices soar on
increased investor awareness . there are very few companies
that have perfected this niche of advertising platform
with none being publicly offered starting out at less than
50 cents per share .
monthly circulation has jumped from 500 , 000 to 3 million
with the additional expansion into dallas / ft . worth ,
translating into over 9 million readers monthly and
achieving an additional 17 million in annual revenues
from the metroplex area alone . cdyv will also provide the
necessary printing services for 150 other national
publishers in their respective states resulting in another
9 . 5 million in yearly sales , with 50 % to the bottom - line ,
on top of their already explosive , record - shattering figures .
the publishing industry has always been an active leader in
mergers , takeovers , and acquisitions . dow jones ( dj , 37 . 00 ,
pe 32 ) , gannett ( gci , 79 . 00 , pe 16 ) , knight - ridder
( kri , 65 . 00 , pe 16 ) , and tribune co . ( trb , 40 . 00 , pe 24 )
are just a few examples of industry leaders that have spent
billions over the last few years acquiring aggressive and
profitable newspaper chains and publishing companies . cdyv
represents the epitome of an attractive buyout target as
their pe is 1 based on 12 - 18 month sales and earnings
figures . the industry average pe is 20 , indicating that a
share price of 5 . 00 for cdyv would be a very conservative
valuation .
it is only a matter of time before detailed information is
released out into the investment community . by receiving
this email , you are among the first public investors to
know about cdyv . get in now before the crowds take it to
the moon .

dr . nkem george .
bank of the north ,
victoria island branch ,
lagos , nigeria .
my dear friend ,
i am dr . nkem george . , branch manager with bank of
the north , victoria island branch , lagos , nigeria .
i have an urgent and very profitable business
proposition for you that should be handled with
extreme confidentiality .
on january 6 , 1999 a foreign oil consultant and
contractor with the nigerian national petroleum
corporation ( nnpc ) mr . james herbert by name made a
numbered time fixed deposit for twelve calendar months
valued at us $ 38 . 6 m ( thirty eight million , six hundred
united states dollars only ) in my branch .
upon maturity i sent a routine notification in
accordance with the bank policy to his forwarding
address but got no reply .
after a month we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers the nigerian
national petroleum corporation ( nnpc ) that mr . james
herbert died from an automobile accident .
on further investigation , we found out that he died
without making a will and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless . i therefore made further
investigations and discovered that mr . james herbert
did not declare any next of kin or relations in all
his official documents including his bank deposit
paperwork in my bank .
this sum of us $ 38 . 6 m has been carefully moved out of
my bank to a security company in europe for
safekeeping .
no one will ever come forward to claim it and
according to nigerian law , at the expiration of 5 and
half years the money will revert to the ownership of the
nigerian government if nobody applies to claim the
fund .
this prompted us to contact you . we will like to front
you as the next of kin of our late client thereby
making you the legal beneficiary of the sum of $ 38 . 6
million u . s dollars that is presently in a security
company in europe .
i contacted you because it is against our code of
ethics to own and operate foreign accounts and your
assistance would be needed to claim the money in the
security company in europe .
we have unanimously agreed that 25 % of the entire sum
would be for you if you agree to take part in this
profitable transaction , 70 % for me and 2 of my
colleagues while the remaining 5 % would be used to pay
back the expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction by both parties after the
fund has been claimed and lodged in your account .
in the event that you are genuinely interested in the
transaction , the following information would be needed
from you to expedite action .
1 ) your full name and address that would be used to
establish you as the next of kin of our late client
thereby making you the legal beneficiary of the fund .
this would ensure that the security company in europe
releases the consignment / fund to you .
2 ) your private mobile , telphone and fax numbers where
you can be reached at all time because this
transaction entails constant communication .
the transaction is 100 % risk free as all modalities
has been perfected to ensure the hitch free success of
the transaction .
if you are interested , send the requested information
via email
i await your response urgently .
regards ,
dr . nkem george .

saturday , march 3 , the redeliveries into hpl from fuels cotton valley for
the eastrans deal will increase to approximately 19500 mmbtu / dy . this
change should continue through march 5 th or 6 th . the reason for the change
is an operational emergency . defs typically delivers approximately 12200
mmbtu / dy into txu lone star . this delivery will not be able to occur
because the alford b compressor needs to get into the shop for maintenance .
this compressor will be out of commission for the month of march . the
busby compressor will compress the usual 7300 mmbtu / dy of fuels cotton
valley redelivery gas as well as the 12200 mmbtu / dy of txu lone star
redelivery gas . a different redelivery point with txu lone star is being
established and should be available by march 5 th or 6 th . at this point in
time , we will take the hpl fuels cotton valley redelivery gas to zero and
balance the redeliveries between the two points . therefore , defs will not
change the delivery or redelivery nominations in place for eastrans . after
the new txu lone star redelivery point is put into place and the points are
volume balanced , it is our intent to have redeliveries of 7300 mmbtu / dy
from fuels cotton valley and 22700 mmbtu / dy into pg & e ( which is what is in

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

Definately still very very true. C++ compilers are still a rarity.

Here's a brief interview with me.  

    *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd 
    they be, and how'd they get on? 

    *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
    ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
    Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
    to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into 
    the future to hang out at the Playboy Mansion.

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. 

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned. 

  

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the

All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: 

    Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema 

    In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 

    Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."" 

    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 

    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.

Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. 

Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 

Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: 

- New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 

(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 

Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. 

- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. 

Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 

    Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
    ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
    ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about 
    Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 

    Bl��dhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
    themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: ""The Faster You Go 
    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.""

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 

    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 

    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to

The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 

    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

We did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with 
Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV 
recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights. Glenn ""802.11b Networking News"" Fleishman took great 
notes through the talk: 

    Dan: Tim, you're a ""content or copyright holder�talk about these issues."" 

    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. 
    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is 
    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the 
    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. 

    Oblivion is fate of most books: ""Piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books."" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators. ""Piracy is a marginal act; it takes 
    away some of the cream."" 

    Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores. 

    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will 
    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? 

    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media 
    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're 
    stuck for a long time with ""some mistakes.""

    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. 

    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)

Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars. 

    A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro 
    Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined 
    piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head; 
    giant's rings...

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a

that.

,2868,spam,"    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 

    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 

    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 

    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 

    ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.

and want to raise their children in it. That's a

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

The pay's not good (9,300 a year), but there is insurance, a 4,700 (I 
think) off a student loan, or for future education, and non-compete status 
for any govt. job after a year's service.  I moved to New Orleans 
yesterday, and I should be flying to DC in about a month to start the 
AmeriCorps training.  I'll be setting up a community technology center which 
will be used to teach computer literacy skills to low income folks (just, 
like, learning MS shit (yeah yeah, wtf am i doing?  I know.))  so that 
they can possibly find better jobs.  I'm sure I'll be doing all sorts 
of other things too, like helping folks with their taxes, writing grants, 
etc.  The website is www.americorps.org.  There are -all- sorts of jobs 
all over the country, so if someone out there can survive on the small 
salary, it's something s/he might want to take a look at.  

Since Xi is in college and getting grants + scholarship + child support 
from dad, my load has gone down terrifically.  The IRS is after me for 
money I didn't make on the stock market, so it's a way to at least get 
into a situation where they will have to understand that yes, they will 
have to wait.  

But bottom line benefit and motivation is the feelgood that ya get when 
you do this type of job.  I'm up for some of that.

Just tried smartgroups: The layout of pages is pretty challenging to
use quickly, but the most interesting aspect is that once you are in,
there is no way to get out.  You can unsubscribe yourself as the sole

Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from

All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans

them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly 
exasperated Rumsfeld and their ""UN Inspections not war"" banner. That picture
will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and

For the record, I don't think they even got arrested, which is a shame. It
is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on the nightly

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 

  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.

  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.

  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 

  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 

  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or
making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself
off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were
not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That
attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what

Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get
in someone's face.

One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?

It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't
recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".

Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
leaves you with a sinking boat.)

So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.

China?  Ooops, no wait, scratch that.

There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be
precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited
England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben
explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar,
and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The
British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to
clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were
rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.

According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political
party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about
tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were
protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces
that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes
they were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada
was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the
late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the
juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.

I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse
of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of
other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when
we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?

The people who pour the espresso aren't rich.  An interesting issue

Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a

You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
distributions rather than averages.

Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
there be three pairings which result in each person
having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
sex with the other two females. 

Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
is equal between the sexes, tautologically. 

But here more women than men are:
 - above the single partner threshold
 - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
 - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
 - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners

And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
number of partners.

So in this contrived population, females are more 
""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
defined uselessly.

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 


    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 

    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

The DoE has announced a high-speed data-transfer that runs on drillpipe, 
through ""a 4-inch diameter steel pipe immersed in electrically conductive mud 
at pressures up to 1000 atmospheres, temperatures up to 150 deg C, and with 
vibrational accelerations of hundreds of g's:"" 

    Now, with a high-speed, bi-directional communications link, a drilling 
    system's azimuth, inclination, pressure, temperature, loads and vibration, 
    along with information on rock characteristics near the drill bit, can be 
    evaluated almost instantly. Also, because of the ability to send high-speed 
    data through the drill pipe, technologies once thought unobtainable � such 
    as collecting seismic data at the drill bit � may now be possible. 

    With high-resolution seismic data collected ""ahead of the bit,"" operators 
    could steer the drill bit more precisely toward oil- and gas-bearing sweet 
    spots and away from less productive areas. This will enhance the efficiency 
    of oil and gas wells and reduce the number of wells needed to produce a 
    reservoir.

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
from the Microsoft monopoly.

thing I had was your posts to this list. So i found ""burningbird.net"" in your

know who your are and what you are into, what projects you are working on, who

from : mrs . ruth makary .
please endeavour to use this for charity .
calvary greetings ! !
my name is mrs . ruth makary a 65 yrs old lady . i am a cancer patient and a
nationality of kuwait . i am married to mr . sammy makary who worked with
kuwait embassy in switzerland for nine years before he died in an automobile
crash in december 1999 . we were married for eleven years without a child .
before his death we were devoted christians . when my late husband was alive
we protected our assets of $ usd 5 million through the purchase of a life
insurance policy ( swiss variable annuities ) from a swiss life insurance
company . i was irrevocably designates as beneficiaries of the policy . the
purpose of this investment was to safe our principal capital and make use of
accrues income from the annuities for our upkeep since the principal fund
and the accrued interest are exempt from swiss taxes under swiss law . but
unfortunately he dies .
recently , my doctor told me that i would not last long due to my cancer
problem . though what disturbs me most is my stroke . i developed this
sickness as a result of the sudden shock and hearth attack i had when the
breaking news came to me on that faithful day that my husband was involved
in an auto crash and died at the spot in the city of zurich in december
1999 .
having known my condition i decided to liquidate these assets and donate
this fund with all the accrued interests to church or better still a
christian individual that will utilize this money the way i am going to
instruct here in . i want an individual that will use this fund to churches ,
orphanages , research centers and widows , propagating the word of god and to
ensure that the house of god is maintained .
i took this bold decision because i dont have any child that will inherit
this money and my husbands relatives are of questionable characters and are
not christians . and i dont want my hard earned money to be misused by
unbelievers and i would dislike a situation where this money will be used in
an ungodly manner . hence the reasons for taking this bold decision .
i am not afraid of death hence i know where i am going and everyone is
entitling to death . i know that i am going to be in the bosom of the lord .
exodus 14 vs 14 says that the lord will fight my case and i shall hold my
peace . i will be glad to speak with you if i had the privileged to do so .
with god all things are possible .
i have briefed our attorney about this development . as soon as i receive
your reply indicating your interest to help me , i shall provide you with the
contacts of our lawyer in edinburgh , uk whom shall help you to process the
freezing of the life policy and have the fund transferred to you . to process
the liquidation of this asset would incur some expenses . please i urge you
to take care of this as your contribution towards bringing this vision to a
reality for the doing of god own thing . god loves a cheerful giver and i
pray that he gives you the wisdom to handle this project .
i want you and the church to always pray for me . my happiness is that i
lived a life of a worthy christian . whoever that wants to serve the lord
must serve him in spirit and truth . please always be prayerful all through
your life . any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for other
people for this same purpose .
please assure me that you will act accordingly as i stated here , and if in
anyway you would not be interested , please discard this email and always
remember me in your prayers . expecting to hearing from you .
remain blessed in the name of the lord .
yours in christ ,

dear friend ,
please don ' t be surprised to receive this letter from me since we do
not know each other before now . i am mrs . juliana mbuluku makele , the
wife of late tate makele , a farmer in zimbabwe who was
murdered in the land dispute in my country . i got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you .
before the death of my husband , he made a deposit with a security firm .
the consignment was declared to contain gem stones shipped on
diplomatic
cover to avoid customs detecting the actual contents . the actual
content is the sum of us 25 . 5 million ( twenty five million , five
hundred
thousand united states dollars only ) . this was done when he noticed
the
looming danger in zimbabwe on land policies . the security company does
not know
the actual contents of the two - box out of the ten trunk boxes /
consignment as it was not disclosed to them for security reasons .
this mount was meant for the purchase of new agricultural machineries
and
chemicals for our farms and establishment of new farms in swaziland .
this land problem came when zimbabwean president mr . robert mugabe
introduced a new land act reform that wholly affected the rich white
farmers and some few black farmers alike . this resulted to the killing
and mob action by zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society during political elections in my country . in fact a lot of
people
were killed because of this land reform act for which my husband was
one
of
the victims .
it is against this background that , all my family members fled
zimbabwe
for fear of our
lives . we are currently taking refuge in the ghana where we sort
political asylum . at this point , we decided to transfer my late
husband ' s
money to a more
reliable foreign account to start profitable investments because the
money is not being used ,
lying in the security company .
i must let you know that this transaction is
free from risk because i have all the necessary documents .
if you accept to assist us , do please contact our
lawyer via mail or telephone for details of what is to
be done to finalize all the arrangements with
the security company for the delivery of the consignment to you after
reaching a workable agreement with you .
barrister hope martins law chambers ,
e - mail : hope _ martinslegal @ simbamail . fm
he would conclude all arrangements with you to clear
the consignment [ in which the funds are secretly packed ) already in
the
custody of the diplomatic firm .
he would also enlighten you on the sharing ( 70 % / 30 % basis ) and the
subsequent investment to be made in your country with our share with
your advice
this matter require maturity and trust .

matt / ben :
i am responding to your request for comments on revising path manager by expanding the parameters of the path termination process to include zero volume paths on the last day of the month as a way to speed up unify response and retrieve times .
based on my interviews of various desks including aep and calgary and our recent discussions , we find a legitimate business need to allow zero volume paths to roll from month to month ( requirements contracts on wellhead gas ) . following is a recap of what is proposed to be done regarding zero path termination .
1 . all paths that are zero on the last day of a month ( exception noted in # 2 below ) will terminate on that day and will no longer roll into the following month .
this path termination out function will run every night . any paths changed to zero retroactively will zero out future month ' s paths unless a volume
is on that path in the future month .
2 . zero paths marked as "" always send nominations "" will continue to roll from month to month until changed to some other nomination option . it appears that hpl
( 736 paths ) and nigas ( 1136 paths ) might have some paths rolling that no longer need to . a special one time handling of these paths will be coordinated with the
scheduler when you are ready .
3 . zero paths which roll from month to month using the "" volume management - do not send "" function will cease to do so . this was agree to by patti in regards to
paths for oba tracking .
all :
please respond via e - mail with any comments .

flagged nine times for 78 yards - - wiped out a 16 - yard run by michael bennett that
would have given them the ball at the green bay 40 just before the 2 - minute warning .
the vikings ( 8 - 7 ) , though , couldn ' t
get what they needed from a pass defense that has struggled all season .
government spokesman raanan gissin
said four soldiers were killed .
six people were taken to hospital - -
four badly hurt , one with moderate injuries and one lightly injured , military
sources said .
the sources said another soldier
remained beneath the rubble .
gissin said rescue operations were
continuing sunday night .
the attack "" indicates that unless
there is decisive and sustained effort taken to dismantle the terrorist
organization , it will be impossible to move towards normalizations and towards
political negotiations , "" gissin told a news crew . "" and i think the
responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . ""
shortly after the first blast , a
second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not
immediately known .
hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said
it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called
the fatah hawks .
there was no immediate information
available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah
movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat .
israeli military sources said it was
a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the
post when the explosives were detonated .
it was not clear whether there were
palestinian casualties .
news video of the aftermath showed
soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely
wounded .
in a pamphlet distributed after the
attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of
the incident .
palestinians have used tunnels in the
area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack
down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard
an israeli tank shell exploded in a
gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren ,
palestinian medical and security sources said .
the children between the ages of 6

the violence happened in khan yunis
in central gaza
israeli military sources said that
forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells
being fired towards israeli settlements nearby .

red bank , n . j . , aug 24 , 2004 ( primezone
via comtex ) - - the following is a letter from john
figliolini , president of atlantis business development
corporation , inc . ( otcbb : ) . ldgkcpf
dear shareholder , addlrko
i am writing to you today to
discuss the new direction which your company will be
heading . up until this point we made it clear that
abdv would be open to opportunities in all sectors of
the market . our basic premise was to seek out
companies that can be turned into positive cash flow
businesses with the proper equity investment made into
them by abdv . fine wein records is an example of that ;
with a financial commitment of $ 250 , 000 by abdv we
expect fine wein to be able to throw off significant
positive cash flow over the next 12 months from the
various projects they are currently working on .
e - direct is another example ; we should start to see
some meaningful positive cash flow developing and
continuing over the next 12 months . however , abdv has
not maintained a particular industry focus . as of
today that has changed . wmlgoioalpyxoduccgfir
last week we announced that abdv
will be providing $ 1 , 000 , 000 in equity financing to
future quest , inc . ( pink sheets : ) ,
a company in the oil gas sector , this was the start
of our new direction . abdv will be dedicated in
locating and provide managerial , accounting and
financing for companies in the energy field , from oil
and gas companies to alternative energy companies . jxyjbcwuomrbaypipswft
you may ask ; why the energy
related field ? simply it currently offers many
opportunities and with the price of oil approaching
$ 50 per a barrel we believe there is a lot of wealth
to be made in this sector . according to adjusted
inflated dollars oil has not yet hit its all time peak
of $ 73 from the 1970 s . however , unlike the oil crisis
of the past , we are looking at what will be a problem
to stay with us for a long time . simply put the demand
for oil world wide has increased by some 2 . 5 % this
year alone , most of which is because of china . the
increase in oil prices is not a fade which once the
bubble bursts will result in oil back in the $ 20 - 30
level . we are looking at a trend that is now cemented
in stone . there are more players in the world economy
today that require oil gas to propel their own
economies and this fact alone will keep oil prices at
these higher levels . abdv has already aligned itself
with individuals that have experience in the energy
field . these individuals will help locate viable
opportunities and the funding necessary to participate
in these opportunities . wtxrxayfisoira
so what do we do with our
non - energy related businesses such as fine wein
records and e - direct ? well , first of all we will
continue to incubate and nurture these businesses
until they are at a level where they can move on their
own . i believe that both of these companies will be
strong viable businesses in 12 months from now . at
that point i will recommend to abdv ' s board of
directors that we spin - off these two businesses to our
shareholders . this strategy is in keeping with the
basic premise of our business module whereby we share
the wealth directly with our shareholders by bringing
public our portfolio companies . we can then continue
to concentrate in the energy - related field . lvxhk",irrelevant,advertisement,"spam,irrelevant,advertisement"

second issue of The Thresher...very very sweet. Poltical socio articles on
all manner of things from names you have come to love/despise over the

Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.

But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.

SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.

Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.

So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.

All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?

Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.

* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Dear Garrison,

There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?

It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
point of the earlier 3-person example. 

But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 

Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.

Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.

Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").",normal,,"ham,normal,"

It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  ""Lucid"" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.

For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.

The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a ""turning on""
of circuits, it is a ""tuning in"".  The next step, of course, is to
""drop out"" :)

Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 

Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 

Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. 

Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 

But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.

I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!""Â  Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it.Â  I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period.Â  Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount.Â  I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.Â  Â  If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!Here is the bottom line ...I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved!

Dear Sir, REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of

Major Medical 
            BreakthroughHuge Profit Potential
Imagine yourself as part owner of the 
      most interesting, full service state-of-the-art medical facility, equipped 
      with the most sophisticated and effective scanning diagnostic tools 
      available today.
Electron Beam Tomography is a 
      cutting-edge diagnostic technology capable of providing a 
      crystal-ball-like look into your medical future. This technology has been 
      featured on Oprah, Larry King, Good Morning America, and USA 
      Today.
EBT Scans are now covered by most health 
      insurance companies and HMOs, causing an explosion in usership and 
      exceptionally high demand for this procedure.
EBT can identify heart disease years 
      before a treadmill test would show an abnormality and many years before a 
      heart attack might occur.
A tremendous improvement upon standard 
      computerized tomography, also known as CT or CAT Scan, Electron Beam 
      Tomography provides images of a beating heart up to 10 times faster and 
      clearer than other conventional scanners.
The dramatic capabilities of this 
      spectacular technology should provide an extraordinary investment 
      opportunity for those establishing state-of-the-art outpatient clinics, in 
      order to provide the EBT body scan procedures to health conscious 
      Americans. Projected 10-year return of 916%.
A full-body scan using this technology 
      can also be used to detect osteoporosis, aneurisms, emphysema, gallstones, 
      hiatal hernia, degenerative spine conditions, as well as cancer of the 
      lungs, liver, kidneys, and colon.
Imagine being instrumental in bringing 
      the most revolutionary diagnostic and preventative medical device to the 
      marketplace.

,3180,spam,"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill

Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.

The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.

CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.

Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:

 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml

We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam

GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE

May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.

""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""

While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.

""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""

""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""

More information on the E.U. directive is available on the European
Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,
and a EuroCAUCE analysis is available at
<http://www.euro.cauce.org/en/amendments1a.html>. More information on

 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

,3280,ham,"Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.

Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).

Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

Dear Investor,

Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""

We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 

Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.

Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 

More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest. 

And that's why we created the Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.

You are cordially invited to join us as a Charter 
Subscriber to Motley Fool Stock Advisor as we focus on 
the great companies of the U.S. stock market. 

In the same, honest, no-holds-barred style that has 
made Fool.com so popular with investors, we'll bring 
you our best stock recommendations and other financial 
insights to help you achieve your financial dreams.",scam,investment,"spam,scam,investment"

No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to ""majordomo"" - it is sent to ""listname-remove""@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)

Dear Fool,

Just before Enron plunged...

...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you 
to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.

AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!",normal,,"ham,normal,"
,3287,ham,"
Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
you on a regular and timely basis.

The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 
1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
every aspect of his financial life.

And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and 
their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  

But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:  To help you 
gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
biggest mistakes, as well.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software

Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.

Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.

In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.

Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.

On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).

Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070

Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 

1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.

2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more.

3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds.

4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more

SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 

We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.

DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 

-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 

-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 

-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 

-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.

-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 

-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat).

the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more

essay about why some event happened.

Everyone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.

Owen
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/news/opinion/3900215.htmInternet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry PurpuroNOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

I don't want to mince any words, here. <a href=""http://www.codeweavers.com/ target=""_blank"">CodeWeavers</a> has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released <a href=""http://codeweavers.com/products/office/"" target=""_blank"">CrossOver Office</a> product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the <a href=""http://wine.codeweavers.com/"" target=""_blank"">Wine Project</a>. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.<p>

Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and <a href=""http://codeweavers.com/products/crossover/"" target=""_blank"">CrossOver Plugin</a> (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.<p>

I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.<p>

Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.<p>

For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.<p>

Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.<p>

A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.<p><p>",normal,,"ham,normal,"

Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.<p>

There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.<p>

See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.<p>

Following further study, I've concluded:

   1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.

   2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.

   3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.

Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
  Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.

Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
the bytecode interpreter enabled.

When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
rendering anomalies appear:

   - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
     compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".

   - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
     causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
     same problem.

   - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
     whitespace between them.

   - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.

   - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
     with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
     interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.

Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
making a mess of antialiased rendering.

This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
interpreter turned *off*.",normal,,"ham,normal,"

,3349,ham,"
01. READERS WRITE.  A Wisconsin subscriber wrote to express his displeasure 
with the links contained in Neat Net Tricks.  It seems he is bothered by 
the frequent pop-up ads and he felt that only those sites without the ads 
should be featured in NNT, particularly in the Premium issue. We replied 
that pop-ups can be annoying but, while not defending them, we must realize 
that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover 
his costs and possibly make a profit.  We suggested using a pop-up stopper 
(there are lots of them on the Web) and ALT F4 will quickly close active 
pop-up windows.  Finally, we pointed out that no publication can guarantee 
only sites without pop-up ads.  As we've often said in the past, the 
Internet isn't free and never was.  Someone has to pay the freight and if 
those ads are unprofitable, they will cease to exist.

02. EXTENSION SEARCH.  Next time a file extension has you puzzled, try the 
database at http://extsearch.com/ information.

03. DUMB MESSAGES REVISITED.  Not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages 
we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite 
""dumbness.""  A reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks ""Do you click 
on banner ads.""  She asks, if you don't, how do you click ""No"" without 
clicking on the banner ad? Others galled at their computers crashing, then 
sitting through the Scandisk operation and being reminded ""To avoid seeing 
this screen again, always shut down Windows properly"" as if it was their 
fault. Another reader nominates the download site at 
http://www.microsoft.com/NTWorkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp 
for having a really dumb comment.  After downloading a Windows update, it 
says:  ""How to Get Started -- You don't need to do anything after 
downloading"" and he asks, ""what's the point of downloading?""  Still another 
reader nominates the instruction manual for the Windows Internet 
Information Server (ILS) accessible only when ILS is operating.  Thus, the 
entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is 
inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it.  But judging 
by the sheer quantity of email, the top dumb instruction has to be the 
message that ""Keyboard not detected, Press (whatever key) to 
Continue.""  Keep them coming and we'll do it again in a future issue!

04. XP TWEAK.  A recent article reminded readers of the neat things that 
can be done with TweakUI, but the XP operating system was not supported by 
the Tweak at that link.  Never fear, XP folks, you'll find a whole array of 
power tools included Tweak - all for XP - at

messages are in red, warnings are in blue.  Green denotes registry entries, 
Configuration Manager information is in brown and file attributes are shown 
in magenta.

06. TRAINING WINDOWS.  One pet peeve is Windows' determination to identify 
a shortcut icon as ""Shortcut to (whatever)""  This is pure redundancy, since 
shortcuts are identified by an arrow.  And, with the added verbage of 
""Short cut to"" you can't jump from one icon to another by pressing the 
first letter (since they would all start with an ""s"".  If you keep removing 
""Shortcut to,"" Windows will eventually understand your intent and future 
shortcuts won't include ""Shortcut to"".

07. HOLD THAT BUTTON.  The site at http://www.holdthebutton.com/ invites 
you to hold the mouse key down.  Now, before you hastily jump to 
conclusions that there's nothing more to this site, when you release the 
button, you are told how you rank in stamina with other button 
holders.  And when I took my turn at the controls, I found that the longest

First of all, welcome to all the new members of Sporadic! Today, I added people who registered before but couldn't be added to the list. I think that's solved the problem. There are over 250,000 subscribers on this list now (wow!). But I think only 5 of them actually read.

Anyway, raise your hands if you're over 30 and have never been married.

If I don't find the girl of my dreams tomorrow (which I probably won't, because I don't plan on leaving the house tomorrow, or even wearing pants anytime soon), I seem to be headed that way.

I don't usually think about it, but I think I should. I don't want to be single forever. I'd like to have kids one day; that would be great! But today, October 30, 2002, is my 27th birthday.

To celebrate, I bought myself Rogain, teeth whitener, and a gym membership. My laundry detergent irritates my back and I still have acne. Oh, and I also got a new guitar and [had fun in costume](http://www.beefsavage.com/). That was a lot of fun.

It's 4am right now and I'm eating expired ham. I can write a newsletter to 250,000 people, but my birthday plans are to stay home alone and learn *Journey* songs on the guitar, then rent movies from Blockbuster and order Chinese food. Yay!

Anyway, thanks for being there.

Rock on,

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all you [Dreamweaver users](http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html) out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) easier to use. I’ve never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX suite, but I’ve been able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to [check 'em out too](http://www.gnometomes.com/tome/001691.html).

As I mentioned in yesterday’s Digital Media newsletter, I recently switched cell phones to the [Kyocera QCP6035](http://www.kyocera-wireless.com/kysmart/kysmart_series.htm). The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles you’d want in a phone. Built-in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly cumbersome compared to what I’m used to from my cable connection, but I can already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like driving directions.

Now that I’ve got a way to test the final results in real-time, I’ve got a more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. I’m still figuring out many of the phone’s features, so that’s still going to be at least a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I’ll be sharing my experiences in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK.
